# Package registry webhooks

You can configure webhooks to be triggered in Package Registries when a package, image, chart, model, module, or file is created.

Webhooks are delivered to an HTTP POST endpoint of your choosing with a `Content-Type: application/json` header and a JSON encoded request body.

## Add a webhook

To add a webhook for your package creation event:

1. Select **Package Registries** in the global navigation > your registry to configure webhooks on.

1. Select **Settings** tab > **Notification Services** page.

1. Select the **Add** button on **Webhook**.

1. Specifying your webhook's **Description** and **Webhook URL**.

1. If you are using self-signed certificates for your webhooks, clear the **Verify TLS Certificates** checkbox.

1. To allow the authenticity of your Package Registries webhook events to be verified, configure your webhook's **Token** value to be sent either as a plain text [`X-Buildkite-Token`](#webhook-token) value or an encrypted [`X-Buildkite-Signature`](#webhook-signature) in the request [header](#http-headers), bearing in mind that the latter provides the more secure verification method.

1. In the **Events** section, ensure the **package.created** event has been selected.

1. Select the **Save Webhook Settings** button to save these changes and add the webhook.

### Package created

The webhook is triggered when a package is created by published through an ecosystem-native CLI or using the [REST API](/docs/apis/rest-api/package_registries/packages).
