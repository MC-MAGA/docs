# Buildkite MCP server overview

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open protocol standard on how to connect artificial intelligence (AI) tools, agents and models to a variety of other systems and data sources.

Buildkite provides its own [open-source MCP server](https://github.com/buildkite/buildkite-mcp-server) to expose Buildkite product data (for example, data from pipelines, builds, and jobs for Pipelines, as well as from test data for Test Engine) for AI tools and editors, as well as AI agents and other products to interact with.

Buildkite's MCP server is built on and interacts with [Buildkite's REST API](/docs/apis/rest-api). Learn more about what the MCP server is capable of in [Available MCP tools](#available-mcp-tools).

To start using Buildkite's MCP server, first determine which [type of Buildkite MCP server](#types-of-mcp-servers) to work with. This next section provides an overview of the differences between these MCP server types and how they need to be configured.

Once you have established which Buildkite MCP server to use (remote or local) and if local, have [installed the MCP server](/docs/apis/mcp-server/local/installing#install-and-run-the-server-locally) and [configured its API access token](/docs/apis/mcp-server/local/installing#configure-an-api-access-token), you can then proceed to configure your AI tools to work with the [remote](/docs/apis/mcp-server/remote/configuring-ai-tools) (recommended) or [local](/docs/apis/mcp-server/local/configuring-ai-tools) MCP server.

## Types of MCP servers

Buildkite provides both a [_remote_](#types-of-mcp-servers-remote-mcp-server) and [_local_](#types-of-mcp-servers-local-mcp-server) MCP server.

### Remote MCP server

The _remote_ MCP server is one that Buildkite hosts, and is available for all customers to access at the following URL:

```url
https://mcp.buildkite.com/mcp
```

This type of MCP server is typically used by AI tools that you interact with directly from a prompt, and is the recommended MCP server type to use.

#### Advantages

Unlike the [local MCP server](#types-of-mcp-servers-local-mcp-server), the remote MCP server has the following advantages.

- You do not need to configure an API access token, which poses a potential security risk, as these types of tokens never expire.

    Instead, you only require a Buildkite user account, and the Buildkite platform issues a short-lived OAuth token, representing this user account for authentication, along with access permission scopes which are pre-set by the Buildkite platform to provide the authorization. This OAuth token auth process takes place after [configuring your AI tool with the remote MCP server](/docs/apis/mcp-server/remote/configuring-ai-tools) and connecting to it.

- There is no need to upgrade your local MCP server. Since the remote MCP server undergoes rapid updates, you don't miss out on newer or updated features, which you'd miss out on by not keeping your local MCP server up to date.

### Local MCP server

The _local_ MCP server is one that you install yourself directly on your own machine or in a containerized environment.

This type of MCP server is typically used by AI tools used as _AI agents_, which an automated system or workflow, such as a Buildkite pipeline, can interact with. AI agent interactions are usually shell-based.

#### Advantages

The local MCP server provides the following advantages.

- This MCP server type is geared for advanced users, allowing such users to develop automated workflows (for example, using [Buildkite Pipelines](/docs/pipelines)), where running a specific version of the MCP server is important, especially for large volume usage of the MCP server, where consistent results from a given set version of the MCP server is a requirement.

- If you want to contribute to the [Buildkite MCP server project](https://github.com/buildkite/buildkite-mcp-server), the local MCP server allows you to run and test your changes locally.

#### Disadvantages

Using the local MCP server also has the following disadvantages.

- You'll need to manage a Buildkite API access token (which inherently never expires) for authentication and authorization. Using these types of tokens can pose a potential security risk if they are accidentally leaked.

- You'll also need to manage upgrades to the MCP server yourself, especially if you choose to install the binary version of the local MCP server, which means you may miss out on new and updated features offered automatically through the [remote MCP server](#types-of-mcp-servers-remote-mcp-server).

Learn more about how to set up and install a local Buildkite MCP server in [Installing the Buildkite MCP server](/docs/apis/mcp-server/local/installing). As part of installing a local Buildkite MCP server, you'll also need to [configure an API access token](/docs/apis/mcp-server/local/installing#configure-an-api-access-token) with the required scopes that your local MCP server will use.

## Available MCP tools

The Buildkite MCP server exposes the following categories of _MCP tools_.

The names of these tools (for example, `list_pipelines`) typically do not need to be used in direct prompts to AI tools or agents. However, each MCP tool name is designed to be understandable, so that it can be used directly in a prompt when you want your AI tool or agent to explicitly use that MCP tool to query the Buildkite platform.

Learn more about MCP tools in the [Core Server Features](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/server-concepts#core-server-features) and [Tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/server-concepts#tools) sections of the [Understanding MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/server-concepts) page in the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) docs.

> ðŸ“˜
> Since Buildkite's MCP server makes calls to Buildkite's REST API, note that only a subset of the resulting fields are returned in the response from the Buildkite API to your AI tool or agent. This is done to reduce noise for your AI tool / agent, as well as reduce costs associated with text tokenization of the response.

### User and authentication

These MCP tools are associated with [authentication](/docs/apis#authentication) and relate to querying details about the access token's user and Buildkite organization they belong to.

### Jobs

These MCP tools are used to retrieve the logs of [jobs](/docs/apis/rest-api/jobs) from a pipeline [build](#available-mcp-tools-builds), as well as unblock jobs in a pipeline build. A job's logs can then be processed by the [logs](#available-mcp-tools-logs) tools of the MCP server, for the benefit of your AI tool or agent.

### Logs

These MCP tools are used to process the logs of [jobs](#available-mcp-tools-jobs), for the benefit of your AI tool or agent. These MCP tools leverage the [Buildkite Logs Search & Query Library](https://github.com/buildkite/buildkite-logs?tab=readme-ov-file#buildkite-logs-search--query-library) (used by the Buildkite MCP server), which converts the complex Buildkite logs returned by the Buildkite platform into [Parquet files](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/), making these logs more consumable for AI tools, agents and large language models (LLMs).

## Smart caching and storage

If the job is in a terminal state (i.e. completed successfully, failed, or canceled), then the job's log is downloaded and stored indefinitely.

Stored in the locations specified in the README's table.

$BKLOG_CACHE_URL can be used for a local or an s3:// path (the latter being better for pipeline usage) and is used to override the first two rows in the table.

If the job is in a non-terminal state (e.g. job is still running or blocked), the cached files are retained for 30 seconds.
