# Buildkite MCP server

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open protocol standard on how to connect AI models to a variety of tools and data sources.

Buildkite provides its own MCP server to expose Buildkite product data (for example, from pipelines, builds, and jobs for Pipelines, as well as from tests for Test Engine) for AI tools, editors and other products.

## Types of MCP servers

Buildkite provides both a remote and local MCP server for you to work with.
