# Installing the Buildkite MCP server locally

The Buildkite MCP server is available to install locally, and is also available remotely at `https://mcp.buildkite.com/mcp`, which is Buildkite's official _remote MCP server_.

While there are no installation requirements for the remote MCP server, this page covers the details and requirements for installing Buildkite's MCP server locally.

## Before you start

To use Buildkite's MCP server locally, you'll need the following:

- A [Buildkite API access token](https://buildkite.com/user/api-access-tokens). Learn more about the required scopes to configure for this token in [Configure required API access token scopes](#configure-required-api-access-token-scopes).

- Internet access to `ghcr.io`.

Specific requirements for each type of local installation method for the Buildkite MCP server are covered in their relevant [installation sections](#install-the-buildkite-mcp-server-locally).

## Configure required API access token scopes

The following sections explain which [scopes](/docs/apis/managing-api-tokens#token-scopes) for your Buildkite MCP server's API access token are required, to access the relevant Buildkite platform functionality for your particular use case. These sets of scopes fit into the following categories:

- [Minimum access](#configure-required-api-access-token-scopes-minimum-access)
- [All read-only access](#configure-required-api-access-token-scopes-all-read-only-access)
- [All read and write access](#configure-required-api-access-token-scopes-all-read-and-write-access)

### Minimum access

Select the following [scopes](/docs/apis/managing-api-tokens#token-scopes) for your MCP server's API access token. These scopes provide your token with the minimum required access permissions on the Buildkite MCP server, and prevents access to more sensitive information within your Buildkite organization.

To create this API access token rapidly through the Buildkite interface, you can do so by [creating a new Buildkite API access token with these pre-selected scopes](https://buildkite.com/user/api-access-tokens/new?scopes%5B%5D=read_builds&scopes%5B%5D=read_pipelines&scopes%5B%5D=read_user).

### All read-only access

Select the following additional [scopes](/docs/apis/managing-api-tokens#token-scopes) for your MCP server's API access token. These scopes provide your token with the [minimum access permissions](#configure-required-api-access-token-scopes-minimum-access), as well as all other read-only access permissions available through the Buildkite MCP server. These include permission to access more information about your Buildkite organization, including clusters, more pipeline build details, as well as access to Test Engine test suite data.

## Install the Buildkite MCP server locally

To install and run the Buildkite MCP server locally, you can do so using [Docker](#install-the-buildkite-mcp-server-locally-using-docker) (recommended) or [Docker Desktop](#using-docker-desktop), or natively as a [pre-built binary](#install-the-buildkite-mcp-server-locally-using-a-pre-built-binary), or [build it from source](#install-the-buildkite-mcp-server-locally-building-from-source).

### Using Docker

To run the Buildkite MCP server locally in Docker:

1. Ensure you have installed and are running [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) version 20.x or later.

1. Open a terminal or command prompt, and run this command to obtain the Buildkite MCP server Docker image.

    ```bash
    docker pull buildkite/mcp-server
    ```

1. Run the following command to spin up the Buildkite MCP server image in Docker.

    ```bash
    docker run --pull=always -q -it --rm -e BUILDKITE_API_TOKEN=<api-token-value> buildkite/mcp-server stdio
    ```

    where `<api-token-value>` is the value of your Buildkite API access token, set with [your required scopes](#configure-required-api-access-token-scopes). This token usually begins with the value `bkua_`.

<h4 id="using-docker-desktop">Using Docker Desktop</h4>

If you have installed and are using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), you can add the Buildkite MCP server to the **MCP Toolkit** area of Docker Desktop by either:

- Selecting **Add to Docker Desktop**:<p></p>
    <a class="inline-block" href="https://hub.docker.com/open-desktop?url=https://open.docker.com/dashboard/mcp/servers/id/buildkite/config?enable=true" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Add%20to%20Docker%20Desktop-17191e?style=flat&logo=docker" class="no-decoration" width="175" height="25"></a>

- Running this command:

    ```bash
    docker mcp server enable buildkite
    ```

### Using a pre-built binary

To run the Buildkite MCP server locally using a pre-built binary, follow these steps, bearing in mind that macOS users can also use the convenient [Homebrew method](#homebrew-method) as an alternative to this procedure:

1. Visit the [buildkite-mcp-server Releases](https://github.com/buildkite/buildkite-mcp-server/releases) page in GitHub.
1. Download the appropriate pre-built binary file for your particular operating system and its architecture. For macOS, choose the appropriate **Darwin** binary for your machine's architecture.
1. Extract the binary and execute it to install the Buildkite MCP server locally to your computer.

> ðŸ“˜
> The installer is fully static, and no pre-requisite libraries are required.

<h4 id="homebrew-method">Homebrew method</h4>

Instead of installing the relevant **Darwin** binary from the [buildkite-mcp-server Releases](https://github.com/buildkite/buildkite-mcp-server/releases) page, you can run this [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) command to install the Buildkite MCP server locally on macOS:

```bash
brew install buildkite/buildkite/buildkite-mcp-server
```

### Building from source

To build the Buildkite MCP server locally from source, run these commands:

1. Ensure you have installed [Go](https://www.docker.com/) version 1.24 or later.

1. Run the following commands to build the MCP server locally from source.

    ```bash
    go install github.com/buildkite/buildkite-mcp-server@latest
    # or
    goreleaser build --snapshot --clean
    # or
    make build    # uses goreleaser (snapshot)
    ```
