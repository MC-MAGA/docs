# Configuring AI tools with the remote MCP server

If you are working directly with AI tools to interact with Buildkite's MCP server, then use the relevant instructions on this page to configure your AI tool to work with the [_remote_ Buildkite MCP server](/docs/apis/mcp-server#types-of-mcp-servers).

> ðŸ“˜
> If you are using an AI agent to work with the _local_ MCP server, ensure you have followed the required instructions on [Installing the Buildkite MCP server](/docs/apis/mcp-server/local/installing) locally first, before proceeding with the relevant instructions on its [Configuring AI tools](/docs/apis/mcp-server/local/configuring-ai-tools) page.

## Amp

You can configure [Amp](https://ampcode.com/) with the remote Buildkite MCP server, by adding the following JSON configuration to your [Amp `settings.json` file](https://ampcode.com/manual#configuration), which requires the `mcp-remote` command argument to allow OAuth authorization. Learn more about this type of configuration in the [Custom Tools (MCP)](https://ampcode.com/manual#mcp) section of the Amp docs.

```json
{
  "amp.mcpServers": {
    "buildkite": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.buildkite.com/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The first time you start using the remote MCP server on Amp, the **Authorize Application** for the **Buildkite MCP Server** page opens. On this page, scroll down and select your Buildkite organization in **Authorize for organization**, followed by **Authorize**.

You're now ready to use the Buildkite's remote MCP server through Amp for this Buildkite organization.

## Claude Code

You can configure [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) with the remote Buildkite MCP server by running the relevant Claude Code command, after [installing Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview).

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http buildkite https://mcp.buildkite.com/mcp
```

## Cursor

You can configure [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) with the remote Buildkite MCP server by adding the relevant configuration to your [Cursor's `mcp.json` file](https://docs.cursor.com/en/context/mcp#using-mcp-json), which is usually located in your home directory's `.cursor` sub-directory.

You can conveniently add this configuration using the following button.

<a class="inline-block" href="https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=buildkite&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5idWlsZGtpdGUuY29tL21jcCJ9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg" alt="Add to Cursor" class="no-decoration" width="160" height="30"></a><br/>

Otherwise, to access the `mcp.json` file through the Cursor app to implement this configuration:

1. From your **Cursor Settings**, select **MCP & Integrations**.
1. Under **MCP Tools**, select **Add Custom MCP** to open the `mcp.json` file.
1. Implement the following update to this file, where if you have other MCP servers configured in Cursor, just add the `"buildkite": { ... }` object to this JSON file.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "buildkite": {
      "url": "https://mcp.buildkite.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Goose

You can configure [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/) with the remote Buildkite MCP server by adding the relevant configuration to the `extensions:` section of your [Goose `config.yaml` file](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/getting-started/using-extensions/#config-entry).

```yaml
extensions:
  buildkite:
    available_tools: []
    bundled: null
    description: null
    enabled: true
    env_keys: []
    envs: {}
    headers: {}
    name: Buildkite HTTP
    timeout: 300
    type: streamable_http
    uri: https://mcp.buildkite.com/mcp
```

## Visual Studio Code

You can configure [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the remote Buildkite MCP server by adding the relevant configuration to your [Visual Studio Code's `mcp.json` file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/mcp-servers#_add-an-mcp-server).

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "buildkite": {
      "url": "https://mcp.buildkite.com/mcp",
      "type": "http"
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can initiate this process through the Visual Studio Code interface. To do this:

1. In the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/getting-started#_access-commands-with-the-command-palette), find and select the **MCP: Add Server** command.
1. Select **HTTP (HTTP or Server-Sent Events)** to start configuring a remote MCP server.
1. For **Enter Server URL**, specify `https://mcp.buildkite.com/mcp`.
1. For **Enter Server ID**, specify `buildkite`.

    Follow the remaining prompts to complete this configuration process.

The first time you start using the remote MCP server on Visual Studio Code, the **Authorize Application** for the **Buildkite MCP Server** page opens. On this page, scroll down and select your Buildkite organization in **Authorize for organization**, followed by **Authorize**.

You're now ready to use the Buildkite's remote MCP server through Visual Studio Code for this Buildkite organization.

## Windsurf

You can configure [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/) with the remote Buildkite MCP server by adding the relevant configuration to your [Windsurf's `mcp_config.json` file](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/mcp#mcp-config-json).

You're now ready to use the Buildkite's remote MCP server through Windsurf for this Buildkite organization.

## Zed

You can configure the [Zed](https://zed.dev/) code editor with the Buildkite MCP server as a locally running binary using the Zed Buildkite MCP extension.

To do add the Buildkite MCP server extension to Zed:

1. Visit Zed's [Buildkite MCP server extension](https://zed.dev/extensions/mcp-server-buildkite) page.
1. Select the **Install MCP Server in Zed** button on this web page to open the **Extensions** window in Zed.
1. In the **Extensions** window, ensure the **Buildkite MCP** extension is shown and select its **Install** button.
1. In the **Configure mcp-server-buildkite** dialog, copy your [configured Buildkite API access token](/docs/apis/mcp-server/local/installing#configure-an-api-access-token) and paste this over the `BUILDKITE_API_TOKEN` value.
1. Select **Configure Server** to save the changes.

    Your configuration should be saved to the [Zed's main `settings.json` file](http://zed.dev/docs/configuring-zed#settings-files), which is usually located within your home directory's `.config/zed/` folder.

Alternatively, you can copy and paste the following configuration as a new entry to [Zed's main `settings.json` file](http://zed.dev/docs/configuring-zed#settings-files), bearing in mind that if you had previously configured an MCP server in Zed, add just the `"mcp-server-buildkite"` object within the existing `"context_servers"` object of this file.

```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "mcp-server-buildkite": {
      "settings": {
        "buildkite_api_token": "bkua_xxxxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
