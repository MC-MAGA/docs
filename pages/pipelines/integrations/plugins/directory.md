# Plugins directory

The _Buildkite plugins directory_ (also accessible from the main [Buildkite website](https://buildkite.com/resources/plugins)), allows you to discover and find all plugins maintained by Buildkite, as well as those from third-party developers.

Once you have [created your own plugin](/docs/pipelines/integrations/plugins/writing), you can also [add it to the plugins directory](/docs/pipelines/integrations/plugins/writing#publish-to-the-buildkite-plugins-directory).

  allow="fullscreen" crossorigin="anonymous" width="100%" height="800px"
  style="border-radius:0 0 8px 8px;box-sizing: border-box;"
/>

Plugins supported by the Buildkite team display the Buildkite logo in the directory, and can be found in the [Buildkite Plugins GitHub organization](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins).

For the instructions on writing and adding your plugin to the Buildkite plugins directory, see [Writing plugins](/docs/pipelines/integrations/plugins/writing).
