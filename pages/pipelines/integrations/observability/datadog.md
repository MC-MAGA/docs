# Setting up Datadog tracing on a Buildkite pipeline

[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is a comprehensive monitoring and analytics platform that combines infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring, and log management, allowing you to track the health and performance of your systems while identifying and troubleshooting issues across your entire deployment pipeline.

Datadog users can send the information about their Buildkite pipelines to Datadog's Continuous Integration (CI) Visibility product, also known as CI Pipeline Visibility, if the **Datadog Pipeline Visibility** notification service was enabled in Buildkite. This way, any organization using both Datadog and Buildkite Pipelines can gain insights into the performance of their pipelines over time and ensure optimal resource utilization throughout their development workflow.

## Configuring the Datadog integration in Buildkite

To set up the Datadog's CI Pipeline Visibility integration for Buildkite:

1. As a [Buildkite organization administrator](/docs/pipelines/security/permissions#manage-teams-and-permissions-organization-level-permissions), go to **Settings** > **Notification Services** and select the **Add** button next to **Datadog Pipeline Visibility**.

1. Complete in the following fields:
    - **Description**: A description to help identify this integration in the future, for example `Datadog CI Pipeline Visibility`.
    - **API key**: Your Datadog API Key. You can generate it in [your Datadog account settings](https://app.datadoghq.com/organization-settings/api-keys).
    - **Datadog site**: The URL of your Datadog site to send notifications to, which is typically `datadoghq.com`. While this is the default value of this field, depending on your location, you might wish to use a different site, for instance, `us3.datadoghq.com` or `us5.datadoghq.com` for US or `ap1.datadoghq.com` for Japan. Learn more about these different sites and the current list of available websites to choose from in [Getting Started with Datadog Sites](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/site/#access-the-datadog-site).
    - **Datadog tags**: your custom tags in Datadog. You can use one tag per line in `key:value` format.
    - **Pipelines**: you can select a subset of pipelines you want to trace in Datadog. Select from:
      * **All Pipelines**.
      * **Only Some pipelines**, where you can select specific pipelines in your Buildkite organization.
      * **Pipelines in Teams**, where you can select pipelines accessible to specific teams configured in your Buildkite organization.
      * **Pipelines in Clusters**, where you can select pipelines associated with specific Buildkite clusters.
    - **Branch filtering**: select the branches that will trigger a notification. You can leave this field empty to trace all branches or select a subset of branches you would like to trace.

1. Click **Add Datadog Pipeline Visibility Notification** button to save the integration.

## Advanced configuration

The following configurations provide additional customization options to enhance the integration between Buildkite and Datadog's CI Pipeline Visibility. These settings allow you to fine-tune how pipeline data is collected and reported, ensuring you get the most valuable insights from your CI/CD metrics.

### Setting custom tags

To create custom tags for filtering the CI Pipeline Visibility results, you can use [`buildkite-agent meta-data set` command](/docs/agent/v3/cli-meta-data). Here is an example of how a tag can be set through a YAML pipeline configuration:

```yaml
steps:
  - key: "dd_key_test_01"
    label: "step_01"
    command: "buildkite-agent meta-data set \"dd_tags.key\" dd_key_test_01"
...
```

After setting your tag and running a build of the pipeline, you'll be able to filter the CI Pipeline Visibility output results using the tag.

#### Numerical measures

Any metadata with a key that starts with `dd_measures.` and contains a numerical value, is set as a metric tag that can be used to create numerical measures. For example:

```yaml
...
 - key: "dd-measures-01"
   label: "step_02"
   command: "buildkite-agent meta-data set \"dd_measures.memory_usage\" {numeric value}"
...
```

In the pipeline span for the resulting pipeline, you'll see a custom tag `memory_usage:{numeric value}`, for example `memory_usage:1000`.

### Correlating infrastructure metrics to jobs

You can correlate jobs with the infrastructure that is running them. To do this, you need to install the [Datadog Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/) in the hosts that are running your Buildkite agents.

## Visualizing pipeline data in Datadog

Once [Datadog tracing has been configured on your Buildkite pipeline](#advanced-configuration) and its builds have been completed, then in the CI Pipeline Visibility interface, navigate to the [CI Pipeline List](https://app.datadoghq.com/ci/pipelines) and [Executions](https://app.datadoghq.com/ci/pipeline-executions) pages to see the CI Pipeline Visibility interface populated with data.

Note that the [CI Pipeline List](https://app.datadoghq.com/ci/pipelines) page in CI Pipeline Visibility displays data for only the default branch of each repository.
