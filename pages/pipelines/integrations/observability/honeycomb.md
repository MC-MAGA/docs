# Using Buildkite with Honeycomb

[Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io/) is an observability and application performance management (APM) platform that helps you monitor and debug your applications.

Honeycomb offers several advantages for Buildkite Pipelines users:

- **Free plan available**: start monitoring your builds without additional costs.
- **Build grouping**: group traced jobs into a single build for better visibility.
- **Comprehensive tracing**: track performance and identify bottlenecks in your CI/CD pipeline.

## Honeycomb integration methods

You can integrate Honeycomb with Buildkite Pipelines using three methods:

- **buildevents binary**: the [buildevents binary](https://github.com/honeycombio/buildevents) captures detailed trace telemetry for each build step. Learn more about configuring this method in [Using the buildevents binary](#using-the-buildevents-binary).
- **OpenTelemetry tracing**: setting your [OpenTelemetry tracing notification endpoint to Honeycomb](/docs/pipelines/integrations/observability/opentelemetry#opentelemetry-tracing-notification-service-honeycomb) sends traces directly from the Buildkite Agent. Learn more about configuring this method in [Using OpenTelemetry tracing](#using-opentelemetry-tracing).
- **Honeycomb Markers Buildkite plugin**: the [Honeycomb Markers Buildkite plugin](https://www.honeycomb.io/integration/buildkite-markers) adds Buildkite Pipelines markers to your traces. However, for security best practice reasons, it is not recommended using this plugin as it is community-maintained with irregular updates.

## Using the buildevents binary

The [buildevents binary](https://github.com/honeycombio/buildevents) generates trace telemetry for your builds, and captures invocation details and command outputs, creating a comprehensive trace of your entire build process.

### How it works

The buildevents binary:

1. Creates _spans_ (individual or grouped executed commands) for each build section and subsection.
1. Tracks the duration of each stage or command.
1. Records success/failure status and additional metadata.
1. Sends the complete trace to Honeycomb when the build finishes.

### buildevents trace structure

The buildevents script needs a unique [Trace ID](https://github.com/honeycombio/buildevents?tab=readme-ov-file#trace-identifier) to connect all the relevant steps and commands with its build. You can use Buildkite's `BUILDKITE_BUILD_ID` environment variable, since its value is unique (when re-running builds, you'll get a new `BUILDKITE_BUILD_ID`), and is also a primary value that Buildkite Pipelines uses to identify the build.

You can get started with using buildevents by following the [installation instructions for buildevents](https://github.com/honeycombio/buildevents?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

After integration, you'll see key telemetry from Buildkite pipelines in Honeycombâ€™s Traces dashboard. Each trace typically represents a full build, and each span represents a job or command.

Metrics visible in this dashboard include:

- **Spans**: count of all job steps traced.
- **Duration data**: visualizes step performance for latency analysis.
- **Status information**: success or failure details.
- **Custom metadata**: additional data you choose to capture.
- **Total Errors**: Spans marked with `error=true`, useful for tracking CI failures.
- **Trace Volume**: One per build, shows build frequency.

Since Honeycomb maintains the buildevents integration, direct questions and feature requests through to [Honeycomb Support](https://www.honeycomb.io/support).

## Explore Data View

The Explore tab lets you inspect spans as individual structured events. You can filter by tags like `trace.trace_id`, `command_name`, `error`, or `duration_ms`. This is helpful for isolating problematic steps, long durations, or agent behavior.

Clicking a trace ID opens the flamegraph (trace view), showing the full build execution timeline.


## Using OpenTelemetry tracing

You can send traces from the Buildkite Agent to Honeycomb with the help of OpenTelemetry by following these steps:

1. Enable OpenTelemetry tracing by setting the `--tracing-backend opentelemetry` flag on your Buildkite Agent.

1. Set the following values in the environment where you are running the Buildkite Agent:

    ```yaml
    OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT="https://api.honeycomb.io"
    OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="x-honeycomb-team=<api_key>"
    OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="buildkite-agent"
    ```

    Replace `<api_key>` with your actual Honeycomb API key.
