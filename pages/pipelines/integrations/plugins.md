# Buildkite plugins

Plugins are small self-contained pieces of extra functionality that help you customize Buildkite to your specific workflow. Plugins modify your build [command steps](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/command-step) at one or more of the ten [job lifecycle hooks](/docs/agent/v3/hooks). Each hook modifies a different part of the job lifecycle, for example:

- Setting up the environment.
- Checking out the code.
- Running commands.
- Handling artifacts.
- Cleaning up the environment.

The following diagram shows how a plugin might hook into the job lifecycle:

Plugins can be *open source* and available for anyone to use, or *private* and kept in private repositories that only your organization and agents can access. Plugins can be hosted and referenced using [a number of sources](/docs/pipelines/integrations/plugins/using#plugin-sources).

Plugins can be also be *vendored* (if they are already present in the repository, and included using a relative path) or *non-vendored* (when they are included from elsewhere), which affects the [order](/docs/agent/v3/hooks#job-lifecycle-hooks) they are run in.

## How to use plugins

Add plugins to [command steps](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/command-step) in your YAML pipeline to add functionality to Buildkite. Plugins can do things like execute steps in Docker containers, read values from a credential store, or add test summary annotations to builds.

Reference plugins in your pipeline configuration, and when the step containing the plugin runs, your agent will override the default behavior with hooks defined in the plugin [hooks](/docs/agent/v3/hooks). In case there is more than one, it will be with the command hook of the first plugin that defines it.

> ðŸ“˜ Plugin execution and conditionals
> Plugins run during the job lifecycle, before the step-level `if` conditionals are evaluated. To conditionally run plugins, use either [group steps with conditionals](/docs/pipelines/configure/conditionals#conditionally-running-plugins-with-group-steps) or [dynamic pipeline uploads](/docs/pipelines/configure/conditionals#conditionally-running-plugins-with-dynamic-uploads).

Some plugins allow configuration. This is usually defined in your `pipeline.yml` file and is read by the agent before the plugin hooks are run. See plugins' readme files for detailed configuration and usage instructions.

See [Using plugins](/docs/pipelines/integrations/plugins/using) for more information about adding plugins to your pipeline definition.

## Finding plugins

Use the [Buildkite plugins directory](/docs/pipelines/integrations/plugins/directory) to find all the plugins maintained by Buildkite, as well as plugins from third-party developers.

## Creating a plugin

Learn more about how to create plugins, along with step-by-step instructions, on the [Writing plugins](/docs/pipelines/integrations/plugins/writing) page, along with some [useful tools](/docs/pipelines/integrations/plugins/tools) to help you develop them.
