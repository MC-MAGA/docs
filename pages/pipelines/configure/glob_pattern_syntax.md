# Glob pattern syntax

A glob pattern is a representation of a file name and optionally its path, and is a compact way of specifying multiple files with a single pattern. You can use a glob pattern to find all files in paths that match that pattern.

This syntax is used for glob patterns supported in pipelines for artifact uploads (using either [`artifact_paths`](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/command-step#command-step-attributes) in a pipeline or [`buildkite-agent artifact upload`](/docs/agent/v3/cli-pipeline)), and `if_changed` conditions on [command](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/command-step#agent-applied-attributes), [trigger](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/trigger-step#agent-applied-attributes) or [group](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/group-step#agent-applied-attributes) pipeline steps.

> ðŸ“˜ Full path matching
> Glob patterns must match whole path strings, and cannot be used to represent substrings. However, glob patterns are evaluated relative to the current directory.

## Syntax elements

Characters match themselves only, with the following syntax elements having special meaning.

Multiple path segments, <code>*</code>, <code>**</code>, etc are all allowed within <code>{}</code>. To specify a path containing <code>,</code> within <code>{}</code>, escape it (that is, use <code>\\,</code>).

### On Windows

The path separator on Windows is `\`, and therefore, `/` is the escape character when the agent performing the action is running on Windows. On other operating system platforms, `/` is the standard path separator and `\` is the standard escape character for the agent.

### Character classes

Character classes (`[abc]`) and negated character classes (`[^abc]`) currently do _not_ support ranges, and `-` is treated literally. For example, `[c-g]` only matches one of `c`, `g`, or `-`.
