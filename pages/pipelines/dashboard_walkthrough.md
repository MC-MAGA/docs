# Dashboard walkthrough

Once you've set up a few pipelines and have run some builds, you can see an overview of them on the dashboard. Each pipeline has a set of metrics to give you an overview of its health and performance.

## Pipeline status

A visual indication of your pipeline's current status. This icon is based on the latest build on your default branch.

<%= image "build-status.png", width: 2028/2, height: 880/2, alt: "Screenshot of the pipeline status icon" %>

## Build history

The build history visualizes the last 30 builds that have been run on your default branch. The height of each bar reflects the build's running time, and its status is represented by its color and in the tooltip on hover.

<%= image "graphs.png", width: 2028/2, height: 880/2, alt: "Screenshot of the build history visualization" %>

## Speed

The speed of your pipeline is calculated from the average of your 30 most recent builds. This helps you keep an eye on your pipeline's speed, and compare performance between pipelines.

## Reliability

The reliability of your pipeline is a calculation based on passing vs failing builds over the last 30 days. This metric helps you to understand the overall stability of your pipelines.

## Builds per week

The builds per week measurement is calculated based on the average number of builds created over the past 4 weeks. This metric helps you to understand how frequently a pipeline is run.

## Bookmarking pipelines

You can keep your most used pipelines at the top of the page by hovering over a pipeline, and selecting the bookmark icon on the right.

## Filtering pipelines

You can filter pipelines using the search bar at the top of the page. This will search the titles of pipelines, and return all those matching your search terms.

<%= image "filtering-pipelines.png", width: 2028/2, height: 880/2, alt: "Screenshot of the filtering text input field" %>

You can add tags to your pipelines and use them to quickly filter pipelines using the search bar. You can manage a pipelineâ€™s tags in the pipeline's **Settings** section.

If your organization has Teams enabled, you can also filter this page by the teams that you're in. When you have more than one team attached to your Buildkite account, you'll see a dropdown list of teams at the top of the dashboard. This defaults to 'All Teams'. Selecting a specific team will filter the list of pipelines to display only those accessible by the selected team.

## Customizing the page

You're able to edit a pipeline's:
- name
- description
- emoji
- color
- repository
- default branch

After you've selected a pipeline, the settings button is in the top right corner.

<%= image "settings.png", width: 2028/2, height: 880/2, alt: "Screenshot of the pipelines settings button" %>

The display settings can be found in the pipeline's **Settings** section. Adding a description, emoji, and color for your pipeline is optional, but name, repository, and default branch are all required.

The emoji and color will replace the icon on the dashboard. Descriptions also have full emoji support. ðŸ™Œ

## Pipeline page

Select a pipeline to view its page, which shows the [build history](#build-history) for that pipeline, your starred branches, and the ten most recently built branches for that pipeline.

<%= image "pipelines-detail.png", width: 2048/2, height: 880/2, alt: "Screenshot of the pipelines settings page" %>

You can filter a pipelineâ€™s builds by branch, build state, or your own builds using the Filter menu.

<%= image "filtering-builds.png", width: 2608/2, height: 1244/2, alt: "Screenshot of the builds filter menu" %>

To see the steps for a build, select the Show steps button on the right of any build.

<%= image "showing-build-steps.png", width: 2408/2, height: 520/2, alt: "Screenshot of toggling build steps" %>

## Build page

Select a build to view its page, which shows the full list of jobs and other steps in that build, the information about who triggered the build, and the controls for rebuilding or canceling the build while it's in progress.

To retry all failed jobs for a build, select the dropdown menu next to the **Rebuild** button, and then select **Retry failed jobs**. This option will only appear in the dropdown menu when the build is finished, and there are eligible jobs to retry. Eligible jobs include command jobs in the failures tab, with the exception of those already waiting for automatic retries. If a pipeline build contains trigger steps, failed jobs in any of its triggered pipelines' builds are also included in the retry. Note that this does not apply to builds triggered by steps where the `async` attribute has been set to `true`.

<%= image "inside-build-page.png", width: 2028/2, height: 880/2, alt: "Inside the build page" %>

Each job in a build has a footer that displays the job exit status, which provides more visibility into the outcome of each job. It helps you to diagnose failed builds by finding issues with agents and pipelines.

Job exit status may include the exit signal reason, which indicates whether the Buildkite agent stopped or the job was canceled.

<%= image "exit-status.png", width: 2048/2, height: 880/2, alt: "Exit status of a job" %>

If you want to access the exit status through an API, it's only available in the [GraphQL API](/docs/apis/graphql-api).
