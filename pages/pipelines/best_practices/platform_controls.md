# Platform controls

This guide is focusing on how platform and infrastructure teams can maintain centralized control while providing development teams with the flexibility they need to run and observe the pipelines in your Buildkite organization.

## Concept of platform management

The key to successful Buildkite administration lies in finding the right balance between centralized control and developer autonomy. Platform teams need to manage shared resources and enforce company-wide standards while avoiding becoming a bottleneck for feature teams.

The distinction between platform (or "infrastructure") and developer teams is that the former gets to specify settings like the size of the infrastructure, machine capacity, maximum rerun attempts, time-outs, etc. in the YAML configurations included in the codebase, that stays unchanged (by the developer teams). The platform team also manages a script that reads these YAML configuration files, generates the correct pipeline(s), and allocates agents (with correct underlying capacity) to run the jobs in those pipelines.

When the resulting pipeline runs, the end user of Buildkite (a member of the developer team) sees [annotations](/docs/agent/v3/cli-annotate) generated from the specific steps that ran just for their run. These annotations can contain useful additional information and context (for example, a link to an internal dashboard in case of an error).

To sum it up:

- Platform teams manage central control while still giving end users of Buildkite (developer teams) as much or as little flexibility as necessary.
- One script can generate many different variations of pipelines, and this allows the platform teams to manage shared logic and run organization-wide checks, for example, [security scanning](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/security/enforcing-security-controls#dependencies-and-package-management).
- Developer teams only get the permissions and information that is relevant to their builds and pipelines.

## Buildkite agent controls

Before the agents in your infrastructure pick start picking up jobs, the infrastructure team (team with [Buildkite organization administrator permissions](/docs/platform/team-management/permissions#manage-teams-and-permissions-organization-level-permissions)) decides how much CPU, RAM, other resources the agents can have, regardless of whether the Buildkite Agents will be [hosted](/docs/pipelines/hosted-agents), [self-hosted](/docs/pipelines/architecture#self-hosted-hybrid-architecture) (running locally), or in the cloud ([AWS](/docs/agent/v3/aws), [GCP](/docs/agent/v3/gcloud), [Kubernetes](/docs/agent/v3/agent-stack-k8s)).

## Clusters and queues

Set your clusters and queues according to our best practices and then provide an internal guide for your engineers in terms of which ones they can use. Only allow the specific number of agents youâ€™d like to be in a queue. Monitor the wait times.

See [Clusters and queues for more details](/docs/pipelines/clusters#clusters-and-queues-best-practices).

Monitor or set a maximum job age for waiting jobs to make sure that wrong queue usage is handled.


## Pipeline templates as platform control tool

Controls and templates can be used in the process of running the pipelines. Initially, the platform team has to create and be responsible for the pipeline YAML and the [pipeline templates](/docs/pipelines/governance/templates).

> ðŸ“˜ Enterprise feature
> Pipeline templates are only available on an [Enterprise](https://buildkite.com/pricing) plan.

Pipeline templates provide platform teams with a powerful mechanism to enforce standardization and security across all CI/CD pipelines in your organization. By creating centrally-managed templates that define approved step configurations, security scanning requirements, deployment patterns, and compliance checks, platform teams can ensure that all development teams follow established best practices without needing to manually review every pipeline.

From an operational perspective, platform teams should leverage pipeline templates to embed infrastructure and security policies directly into the CI/CD workflow. Templates can include mandatory steps for vulnerability scanning, artifact signing, infrastructure-as-code validation, and deployment approvals, ensuring that every build follows your organization's security and compliance requirements.

The ability to update templates centrally means that policy changes or security improvements can be rolled out instantly across all pipelines using that template, eliminating the need to coordinate updates across multiple development teams. Additionally, platform teams can create different template variants for different environments or application types (microservices, frontend applications, data pipelines) while maintaining consistent underlying security and infrastructure patterns, providing both flexibility and control over your organization's build and deployment processes.

## Access with least privilege

Buildkite's teams feature provides platform teams with granular access controls and functionality management across pipelines, test suites, and registries throughout your organization. These controls help standardize operations while providing teams with necessary flexibility to manage their own resources within defined boundaries.

### Organization-level control

Platform administrators maintain full organizational oversight through Buildkite organization administrator privileges, allowing them to:

- Enable and configure the teams feature across the organization
- Create, modify, and delete teams as organizational needs evolve
- Set organization-wide policies and security configurations
- Access audit logs and usage reports for compliance and monitoring
- Manage integrations and organization-level settings

### Team-based access management

Structure your teams to align with your organizational hierarchy and security requirements:

- **Product-based teams**: organize teams around product lines or business units.
- **Function-based teams**: create teams for infrastructure, security, frontend, and backend functions.
- **Environment-based access**: control who can access staging, production, and development environments.
- **Cross-functional teams**: enable collaboration while maintaining appropriate access boundaries.

### Permission levels and controls

The teams feature provides three distinct permission levels for different resources:

- **Full Access**: Complete control over pipelines, test suites, and registries.
- **Build & Read** (pipelines): Ability to trigger builds and view pipeline details.
- **Read Only**: View-only access for monitoring and reporting purposes.

### Automated team management

Leverage programmatic controls to maintain consistency:

- Use the GraphQL API for automated team provisioning and user management.
- Implement SSO integration to automatically assign new users to appropriate teams.
- Configure agent restrictions using the `BUILDKITE_BUILD_CREATOR_TEAMS` environment variable.
- Set up automatic team membership for new organization members.

### Security incident response

Platform teams can quickly respond to security incidents by immediately removing compromised users from the organization, which instantly revokes all their access to organizational resources. For organizations with SSO enabled, coordinate user removal both in Buildkite and your SSO provider to prevent re-authentication.

See more in [Teams permissions](/docs/platform/team-management/permissions#manage-teams-and-permissions).

## Telemetry reporting

Platform teams should implement comprehensive telemetry and observability solutions to monitor pipeline performance, identify reliability issues, and optimize CI/CD infrastructure. Effective telemetry provides actionable insights into build patterns, failure rates, resource utilization, and team productivity while enabling data-driven infrastructure decisions.

You can turn Buildkite into a firstâ€‘class source of operational truth for your CI fleet by combining inâ€‘product metrics with open telemetry streams, your preferred observability backend, and Buildkiteâ€™s realâ€‘time event feeds.

## Centralize observability

Ensure all pipelines report metrics to your centralized monitoring system for:

- Build success/failure rates
- Queue wait times
- Agent utilization
- Cost per pipeline/team

## Standardized retry policies

Platform teams should implement consistent retry policies across all pipelines to handle transient failures gracefully while avoiding unnecessary resource consumption. Well-designed retry strategies distinguish between different types of failures and apply appropriate retry logic based on the likelihood of success upon retry.

### Automatic retry configuration

#### Exit code-based retry policies

Define specific retry behaviors for different failure categories using Buildkite's automatic retry functionality:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Test Suite"
    command: run_tests.sh
    retry:
      automatic:
        - exit_status: 1      # Test failures - may pass on retry
          limit: 2
        - exit_status: 255    # Infrastructure issues - likely transient
          limit: 3
        - exit_status: 130    # SIGINT/timeout - resource contention
          limit: 1
        - exit_status: 137    # SIGKILL/OOM - memory issues
          limit: 1
```

#### Conditional retry strategies

Implement more sophisticated retry logic that considers build context and failure patterns:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Integration Tests"
    command: integration_test_runner.sh
    retry:
      automatic:
        # Network-related failures - aggressive retry
        - exit_status: 2
          limit: 5
        # Database connection issues - moderate retry
        - exit_status: 3
          limit: 3
        # Authentication failures - single retry only
        - exit_status: 4
          limit: 1
      manual:
        # Allow manual retry for complex failures
        allowed: true
        permit_on_passed: false
        reason: "Manual investigation required"
```

#### Environment-specific retry policies

Tailor retry behavior based on the deployment environment and criticality:

```yaml
# Production deployment - conservative retries
- label: "Deploy to Production"
  command: deploy_production.sh
  retry:
    automatic:
      - exit_status: 255    # Infrastructure only
        limit: 2
  if: build.branch == "main"

# Development environment - aggressive retries
- label: "Deploy to Development"
  command: deploy_development.sh
  retry:
    automatic:
      - exit_status: "*"    # Any failure
        limit: 3
  if: build.branch =~ /^feature\//
```

### Platform-wide retry standards

#### Centralized retry policies

Use pipeline templates to enforce consistent retry behavior across the organization:

```yaml
# In your pipeline template
common_retry_policies: &retry_policies
  retry:
    automatic:
      - exit_status: 1      # Test failures
        limit: 2
      - exit_status: 2      # Build failures
        limit: 1
      - exit_status: 255    # Infrastructure
        limit: 3
    manual:
      allowed: true
      permit_on_passed: false

steps:
  - label: "Unit Tests"
    command: npm test
    <<: *retry_policies
  - label: "Integration Tests"
    command: npm run test:integration
    <<: *retry_policies
```

#### Workload-specific retry patterns

Define different retry strategies for different types of workloads:

```yaml
# High-availability service retries
high_availability_retry: &ha_retry
  retry:
    automatic:
      - exit_status: "*"
        limit: 5

# Security scanning retries (conservative)
security_scan_retry: &security_retry
  retry:
    automatic:
      - exit_status: 255    # Infrastructure only
        limit: 2
    manual:
      allowed: false        # No manual retries for security

# Performance testing retries (resource-aware)
performance_test_retry: &perf_retry
  retry:
    automatic:
      - exit_status: 137    # OOM errors
        limit: 1
      - exit_status: 124    # Timeouts
        limit: 2
```

## Custom exit codes and failure classification

Implement standardized exit codes across your organization to enable intelligent retry policies, better error reporting, and automated incident response. Well-defined exit codes help platform teams understand failure patterns and optimize pipeline reliability.

### Exit code standardization

#### Organizational exit code conventions

Establish consistent exit code meanings across all build scripts and tools. For example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Standard exit codes for organizational use

# Success
readonly EXIT_SUCCESS=0

# Test and build failures (retryable)
readonly EXIT_TEST_FAILURE=1
readonly EXIT_BUILD_FAILURE=2
readonly EXIT_LINT_FAILURE=3

# Infrastructure failures (highly retryable)
readonly EXIT_NETWORK_ERROR=10
readonly EXIT_DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE=11
readonly EXIT_RESOURCE_EXHAUSTION=12

# Configuration failures (not retryable)
readonly EXIT_CONFIG_ERROR=20
readonly EXIT_AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE=21
readonly EXIT_PERMISSION_DENIED=22

# Security failures (critical, not retryable)
readonly EXIT_SECURITY_VIOLATION=30
readonly EXIT_VULNERABILITY_DETECTED=31
readonly EXIT_COMPLIANCE_FAILURE=32

# System failures (infrastructure retryable)
readonly EXIT_TIMEOUT=124
readonly EXIT_SIGKILL=137
readonly EXIT_SIGTERM=143
readonly EXIT_INFRASTRUCTURE=255

# Example usage in a test script
run_security_scan() {
    if ! security_scanner --config security.yaml; then
        echo "Security vulnerabilities detected"
        exit $EXIT_VULNERABILITY_DETECTED
    fi
}

run_unit_tests() {
    if ! npm test; then
        echo "Unit tests failed"
        exit $EXIT_TEST_FAILURE
    fi
}
```

## Custom checkout scripts

Platform teams can standardize code checkout processes across all pipelines by implementing custom checkout hooks that gather consistent metadata, enforce security policies, and prepare the build environment according to organizational standards. Custom checkout scripts ensure that every job starts with the same foundation while accommodating different repository and project requirements.

### Implementing standardized checkout workflows

#### Agent-level checkout hooks

Create agent hooks that run for every job, regardless of pipeline or repository:

- Place custom checkout scripts in the agent's hooks directory (configured by the [`hooks-path`](/docs/agent/v3/configuration#hooks-path) setting)
- Use the `checkout` hook to completely override the default git checkout behavior with your organization's standards
- Implement `pre-checkout` and `post-checkout` hooks to perform setup and validation tasks around the standard checkout process

#### Repository-specific enhancements

Supplement agent-level hooks with repository-specific checkout customizations:

- Create `.buildkite/hooks/post-checkout` scripts in repositories that need additional setup after code retrieval
- Implement repository-specific environment variable configuration and dependency preparation
- Add project-specific validation checks that run immediately after checkout

## Plugin management and standardization

Platform teams can leverage Buildkite plugins to standardize tooling, enforce best practices, and reduce configuration duplication across pipelines. By creating and managing a curated set of plugins, platform teams can provide development teams with approved, secure, and well-maintained tools while maintaining control over the CI/CD environment.

### Private plugin development

You can [write](/docs/pipelines/integrations/plugins/writing) a [private plugin](/docs/pipelines/integrations/plugins/using#plugin-sources) when you need to implement organization-specific requirements or standardize complex workflows:

- **Security and compliance integration**: develop plugins that automatically integrate with your organization's security scanning tools, compliance frameworks, or audit logging systems.
- **Deployment standardization**: create plugins that encapsulate your organization's deployment patterns, environment-specific configurations, and rollback procedures.
- **Infrastructure automation**: build plugins that interact with your internal APIs, infrastructure provisioning systems, or monitoring platforms.
- **Quality gate enforcement**: Implement plugins that enforce code quality standards, testing requirements, or documentation completeness checks.

### Reusable functionality patterns through plugins

You can extract common pipeline functionality into plugins to reduce duplication and ensure consistency:

- Multi-environment deployment pipelines with approval gates.
- Artifact packaging and distribution processes.
- Performance testing and benchmarking procedures.
- Container image building and security scanning workflows.

### Plugin source management

Platform teams should establish clear governance around plugin sources and usage:

- **Buildkite-maintained plugins**: use these for standard functionality like Docker, Docker Compose, and common testing frameworks.
- **Approved third-party plugins**: maintain an allowlist of vetted community plugins that meet your security and reliability standards.
- **Private organizational plugins**: host your custom plugins in private repositories using fully qualified Git URLs for sensitive or proprietary functionality.

Implement strict version management practices to ensure reliability and security:

- Always pin plugins to specific versions or commit SHA values to prevent unexpected changes: `docker#v3.3.0` or `my-plugin#287293c4`.
- Regularly audit and update plugin versions as part of your maintenance cycle.
- Use YAML anchors to centralize plugin configuration and ensure consistency across pipelines.
- Monitor plugin repositories for security vulnerabilities and updates.

#### Plugin orchestration

Design plugin workflows that work together seamlessly across pipeline steps:

- Use plugins that leverage Buildkite's meta-data store to share information between steps
- Create plugin chains that handle complex workflows like build â†’ test â†’ security scan â†’ deploy
- Implement plugins that can conditionally execute based on previous step results or build metadata

### Plugin access control and security

Platform administrators can control plugin usage through agent configuration:

- Use the [agent's plugin restrictions](/docs/agent/v3/securing#restrict-access-by-the-buildkite-agent-controller-allow-a-list-of-plugins) to allowlist approved plugins.
- Set the [`no-plugins`](/docs/agent/v3/configuration#no-plugins) option to disable plugins entirely on sensitive agents.
- Implement different plugin policies for different agent clusters based on security requirements.

### Private plugin distribution

For sensitive or proprietary functionality, use private Git repositories:

```yml
steps:
  - command: deploy to production
    plugins:
      - ssh://git@github.com/your-org/deployment-plugin.git#v1.0.0:
          environment: production
          approval_required: true
      - file:///internal/monitoring-plugin.git#v2.0.0:
          alert_channels: ["#ops", "#security"]
```

### Plugin security

- Regularly audit plugin permissions and access patterns
- Use separate Git repositories for different security domains
- Implement code review processes for all plugin changes
- Monitor plugin usage across your organization to identify potential security risks or optimization opportunities

By establishing comprehensive plugin management practices, platform teams can provide development teams with powerful, standardized tools while maintaining security, compliance, and operational consistency across the entire CI/CD ecosystem.

## Annotations

Talk about how you can use annotations to communicate and link other documents/systems. So add internal frequently asked questions, monitoring dashboards to annotations. Give your contact details/ticketing system to raise things through.

## Cost and billing controls

Platform teams can implement various controls and optimization methods to manage Buildkite infrastructure costs effectively. These approaches help balance performance requirements with budget constraints while maintaining visibility into resource utilization across your organization.


### User and license management

With the cost of using Buildkite (depending on your tier) is partially based on the number of users, the platform team or (platform administrator) can track the number of users in an organization with the help of the following GraphQL query:

```graphql
query getOrgMembersCount {
  organization(slug: "org-slug") {
    members(first:1) {
      count
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, Buildkite organization administrators can view the number of users in a Buildkite organization in https://buildkite.com/organizations/~/users.

It's also recommended to:

- Monitor user activity and remove inactive accounts to optimize license costs.
- Implement automated user provisioning and deprovisioning workflows integrated with your identity management system.
- Track user activity patterns using [GraphQL organization queries](/docs/apis/graphql/cookbooks/organizations) to identify optimization opportunities.
- Set up alerts when user counts approach license limits to prevent overage charges.

## Implement cost allocation

Implement comprehensive cost allocation mechanisms to understand and optimize spending:

- Tag builds with team, project, or department identifiers to enable cost attribution.
- Generate regular usage reports that break down compute hours by team, project, and queue type.
- Track peak usage periods to optimize scaling schedules and resource allocation.
- Monitor artifact storage costs and implement retention policies for large or frequently uploaded artifacts.

### Proactive cost management

Set up monitoring and alerting systems to prevent unexpected cost overruns:

- Configure alerts for unusual usage spikes that could indicate runaway builds or security incidents.
- Implement build timeout policies to prevent stuck or infinite-loop jobs from consuming resources.
- Set up automated reporting that provides cost visibility to team leads and budget owners.
- Create dashboards that show real-time cost trends and projections for proactive budget management.

### Cost optimization workflows

- Establish regular review cycles to assess queue utilization and right-size resources.
- Implement automated policies that pause or scale down underutilized queues.
- Create cost-aware pipeline design guidelines that help teams optimize their build configurations.
- Use build duration and queue wait time metrics to identify opportunities for parallelization or resource optimization.

By implementing these cost controls, platform teams can maintain predictable infrastructure spending while ensuring that development teams have the resources they need for efficient CI/CD operations.

## Enabling developers

### Self-service pipelines

- Curated templates: Allow teams to adopt pipelines without deep Buildkite expertise.
- Golden paths: Document and promote recommended workflows to reduce cognitive load.
- Feedback loops: Encourage engineers to propose improvements or report issues.
