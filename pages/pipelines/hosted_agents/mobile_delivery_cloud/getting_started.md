# Getting started with Mobile Delivery Cloud

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Buildkite Mobile Delivery Cloud! You can use Mobile Delivery Cloud to help you run CI/CD pipelines to build your mobile apps, and track and analyze automated tests, as well as house your built mobile app artifacts within appropriate registries, all within a matter of steps.

This getting started page is a tutorial that helps you understand Mobile Delivery Cloud's fundamentals, by guiding you through the process of setting up Buildkite macOS hosted agents to run a Buildkite pipeline that creates a basic iOS app for deployment.

## Before you start

- To have made your own copy or fork of the [FlappyKite](https://github.com/buildkite/FlappyKite) repository within your own GitHub account.

## Set up your hosted agent

An agent is a small, reliable, and cross-platform program that runs pipeline builds. The agent polls Buildkite for work, runs jobs, and reports results.

Mobile Delivery Cloud uses [Buildkite hosted agents](/docs/pipelines/hosted-agents/overview) running [macOS](/docs/pipelines/hosted-agents/macos), which are configured through a [_cluster_](/docs/pipelines/glossary#cluster). Clusters provide a mechanism to organize your pipelines and agents together, such that the pipelines associated with a given cluster can _only_ be built by the agents (defined within [_queues_](/docs/pipelines/glossary#queue)) in the same cluster.

By default, Buildkite organizations have one cluster, named **Default cluster** with a single self-hosted queue, named with the key **default**. A cluster maintainer or Buildkite organization administrator can customize these default names.

You need at least one Buildkite hosted agent queue configured to run a build.

### Create a Buildkite hosted agent for macOS

You can create the first [Buildkite hosted agent](/docs/pipelines/hosted-agents/overview) for [macOS](/docs/pipelines/hosted-agents/macos) within a Buildkite organization for a two-week free trial, after which a usage cost (based on the agent's capacity) is charged per minute.

To create your macOS hosted agent:

1. Navigate to the [cluster](/docs/clusters/manage-clusters) you want to run your pipeline in. To do this, select **Agents** in the global navigation to access the **Clusters** page.
1. Select the cluster (for example, **Default cluster**) to which the hosted agent will be added.
1. Follow the [Create a Buildkite hosted queue](/docs/clusters/manage-queues#create-a-buildkite-hosted-queue) > [Using the Buildkite interface](/docs/clusters/manage-queues#create-a-buildkite-hosted-queue-using-the-buildkite-interface) instructions to begin creating your hosted agent within its own queue.

    As part of this process:
    * Give this queue an intuitive **key** and **description**, for example, **buildkite-macos-hosted-queue** and **Buildkite macOS hosted queue**, respectively.
    * In the **Select your agent infrastructure** section, select **Hosted**.
    * Select **macOS** as the **Machine type** and **Medium** for the **Capacity**. While small capacity machines are only available on the trial, larger capacity machines allow your pipelines to run faster, since these pipelines typically execute device emulators, which can be computationally intensive, as part of the build process.

1. Make your pipelines use your new macOS hosted agent by default, by ensuring its queue is the _default queue_. This should be indicated by **(default)** after the queue's key on the cluster's **Queues** page. If this is not the case and another queue is marked **(default)**:

    1. On the cluster's **Queues** page, select the queue with the hosted agent you just created.
    1. On the queue's **Overview** page, select the **Settings** tab to open this page.
    1. In the **Queue Management** section, select **Set as Default Queue**.

Your Buildkite macOS hosted agent, as the new default queue, is now ready to use.

## Create a pipeline

_Pipelines_ are how Buildkite represents a CI/CD workflow. You define each pipeline with a series of _steps_ to run. When you trigger a pipeline, you create a _build_, and steps are dispatched as _jobs_ to run on agents, such as the [macOS agent you just created](#set-up-your-hosted-agent-create-a-buildkite-hosted-agent-for-macos). Jobs are independent of each other and can run on different macOS agents.

Next, you'll create a new pipeline to build the example [FlappyKite Swift application](https://github.com/buildkite/FlappyKite) (app). This simple example of a mobile app starts with an initial blank screen, and a plus (**+**) button at its top. Each time you tap this button, a new timestamp is generated successively down the screen.

The source code for this app contains the Buildkite pipeline in its `.buildkite` folder. This pipeline:

- Runs two iOS emulators (one each for the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro models) to test the app, which in turn, takes screenshots of the app after the **+** button is tapped a few times as part of a UI test.
- Leverages [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) to automate deployments and releases. Learn more about fastlane from the [fastlane documentation](https://docs.fastlane.tools/).

To create the new Buildkite pipeline for this app:

1. [Add a new pipeline](https://buildkite.com/new) in your Buildkite organization, select your GitHub account from the **Any account** dropdown, and specify [your copy or fork of the 'FlappyKite' repository](#before-you-start) for the **Git Repository** value.

1. On the **New Pipeline** page, select the cluster you [created the hosted agent for macOS](#set-up-your-hosted-agent-create-a-buildkite-hosted-agent-for-macos) in.

1. If necessary, provide a **Name** for your new pipeline.

1. Select the **Cluster** of the [agent you had previously set up](#set-up-your-hosted-agent).

1. If your Buildkite organization already has the [teams feature enabled](/docs/platform/team-management/permissions#manage-teams-and-permissions), choose the **Team** who will have access to this pipeline.

1. Leave all other fields with their pre-filled default values, and select **Create Pipeline**. This associates the example repository with your new pipeline, and adds a step to upload the full pipeline definition from the repository.

1. On the next page showing your pipeline name, select **New Build**. In the resulting dialog, create a build using the pre-filled details.

    1. In the **Message** field, enter a short description for the build. For example, **My first build**.
    1. Select **Create Build**.

1. After a few minutes, and when the pipeline has completed its build, expand the **screenshots** job.

1. Select the **Artifacts** tab to reveal the two screenshots taken (one from each iOS emulator) after the UI tests 'tap' the **+** button three times.

1. Select each screenshot to view the results, such as the following from the main screen of the app run by the pipeline in an iPhone 16 Pro emulator.

<%= image "iphone16pro-01mainscreen.png", width: 610, height: 610, alt: "Screenshot from the main screen of an iPhone 16 Pro" %>

## Next steps

That's it! You've successfully configured a Buildkite hosted macOS agent, built an iOS app, and checked its functionality using emulators run by the build. ðŸŽ‰
