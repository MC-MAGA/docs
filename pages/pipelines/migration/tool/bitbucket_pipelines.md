# Bitbucket Pipelines

The [Buildkite migration tool](/docs/pipelines/migration/tool) helps you convert your Bitbucket pipelines into Buildkite pipelines. This page lists the Buildkite migration tool's currently supported, partially supported, and unsupported keys (known as _properties_ in Bitbucket Pipelines) when translating from Bitbucket pipelines to Buildkite pipelines.

For any partially supported and unsupported **Key**s listed in the tables on this page, you should follow the instructions provided in their relevant **Notes**, for details on how to successfully complete their translation into a working Buildkite pipeline.

> ðŸ“˜
> The Bitbucket Pipeline configuration that is referred to in various sections below is specified in the central `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` within a specific Bitbucket workspace [repository](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/what-is-a-workspace/). In Buildkite, the pipeline configuration can be set in a singular `pipeline.yml` within a repository or it can also be set and uploaded dynamically through the use of [Dynamic Pipelines](/docs/pipelines/configure/dynamic-pipelines). Additionally, control and governance of Buildkite pipelines can be achieved through the use of [Pipeline Templates](/docs/pipelines/templates) to set shared pipeline configuration within a Buildkite organization.

## Using the Buildkite migration tool with Bitbucket

To start converting your Bitbucket pipeline into Buildkite Pipelines format:

1. Open the [Buildkite migration interactive web tool](https://buildkite.com/resources/migrate/) in a new browser tab.
1. Select **Bitbucket Pipelines** at the top of the left panel.
1. Copy your Bitbucket pipeline configuration and paste it into the left panel.
1. Select **Convert** to reveal the translated pipeline configuration in the **Buildkite Pipeline** panel.

For example, when converting the following example Bitbucket pipeline configuration:

```yml
image: node:18

pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        name: Build
        script:
          - npm install
```

The Buildkite migration tool should translate this to the following output:

```yml
---
steps:
- commands:
  - npm install
  plugins:
  - docker#v5.10.0:
      image: node:18
  label: Build
```

The Buildkite migration tool interface should look similar to this:

<%= image "migration-tool-bitbucket.png", alt: "Converting a Bitbucket pipeline in Buildkite migration tool's web UI" %>

You might need to adjust the converted Buildkite pipeline output to ensure it is consistent with the [step configuration conventions](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types) used in Buildkite Pipelines.

> ðŸ“˜
> Remember that not all the features of Bitbucket can be fully converted to the Buildkite Pipelines format. See the following sections to learn more about the compatibility, workarounds, and limitation of converting Bitbucket pipelines to Buildkite Pipelines.

## Clone

| <div style="width: 50px;">Key</div>  | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clone` | Partially | Clone options for all steps of a Bitbucket pipeline. The majority of these options need to be set on a Buildkite Agent itself through its [configuration of properties](/docs/agent/v3/configuration) such as the clone flags (`git-clone-flags` or `git-clone-mirror-flags` if utilizing a Git mirror), fetch flags (`git-fetch-flags`) - or changing the entire checkout process in a customized [plugin](/docs/plugins/writing) overriding the default agent `checkout` hook. <br/><br/> Sparse-checkout properties of `code-mode`, `enabled`, and `patterns` used in a Bitbucket pipeline will be translated to the respective properties within the [sparse-checkout-buildkite-plugin](https://buildkite.com/resources/plugins/buildkite-plugins/sparse-checkout-buildkite-plugin/). <br/><br/> `clone` properties in a Bitbucket pipeline have higher precedence over these global properties. |

## Export

| <div style="width: 70px;">Key</div> | Supported | Notes |

{: class="responsive-table"}

## Image

| <div style="width: 50px;">Key</div> | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `image` | Yes | The container image that applies to each step within a Bitbucket pipeline, using the image specified within the [docker-buildkite-plugin](https://buildkite.com/resources/plugins/buildkite-plugins/docker-buildkite-plugin/). This has a lower precedence over a per-step `image` configuration (see `pipelines.default.step.image`). |
| `aws`, `aws.oidc`, `name`, `username`, `password` | Partially | Supported through the use of the corresponding plugin ([Docker Login](https://buildkite.com/resources/plugins/buildkite-plugins/docker-login-buildkite-plugin) or [ECR](https://buildkite.com/resources/plugins/buildkite-plugins/ecr-buildkite-plugin/)). |
{: class="responsive-table"}

## Options

| <div style="width: 50px;">Key</div> | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `options` | Partially | Customized options utilized throughout a Bitbucket pipeline. |
| `max-time`, `size`| Partially | This property is supported for translation within the Buildkite migration tool into the generated Buildkite Pipelines command step's `timeout_in_minutes`. |
| `size`| Partially | This property is supported for translation within the Buildkite migration tool into the generated Buildkite Pipelines command step's agent tag. |
| `docker` | No | This property is not supported and will depend on the agent configuration the corresponding Buildkite Pipelines command step is being targeted to run said job has available. |
{: class="responsive-table"}

Note that both supported properties in the Bitbucket pipeline step-level definition will have higher precedences than the two values set at `options` level.

## Pipeline starting conditions

Bitbucket Pipelines allows the configuration of various pipeline start conditions, with each condition supporting different configuration and permissible properties like `branches`, `custom`, `default`, `pull_request`, `tags`, and more. For information on each of these individual starting conditions, refer to the Bitbucket Pipeline's [Starting conditions](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/pipeline-start-conditions/#Custom--manual--pipeline-variables) documentation.

## Pipeline properties

Each [starting pipeline condition](#pipeline-starting-conditions) in Bitbucket can support various pipeline properties like `parallel`, `step`, `stage`, `variables` and so on.

For information on each of these individual properties, see the Bitbucket Pipelines documentation for [parallel](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/parallel-step-options/#Parallel), [step](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/step-options/#The-Step-property), [stage](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/stage-options/#Stage), and [variable](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/pipeline-start-conditions/#Custom--manual--pipeline-variables) properties.

Additionally, implementation of these pipeline properties can be enhanced with best practices by using [dynamic pipelines](/docs/pipelines/configure/dynamic-pipelines) to generate and upload pipeline configuration dynamically and using [conditionals](/docs/pipelines/configure/conditionals#conditionals-in-pipelines) at both pipeline level and step level to apply jobs only when certain conditions are met, and setting [trigger steps](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/trigger-step) with required attributes and environment variable configurations passed through to the triggered builds.

### Parallel

| `pipelines.<start-condition>.parallel` | Yes | The grouping of multiple steps within a Bitbucket pipeline to be run concurrently. By default, Buildkite executes steps in parallel, unless [implicit or explicit dependencies](/docs/pipelines/dependencies) are set. Parallel Bitbucket pipeline steps are transitioned into a [group step](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/group-step) within the generated Buildkite pipeline without explicit dependencies. |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.parallel.fail-fast` | No | Whether a Bitbucket pipeline allows this parallel step to fail entirely if it fails (set as `true`), or allows failures (set as `false`). Consider using a combination of `soft_fail` and/or `cancel_on_build_failing` in the corresponding Buildkite Pipelines command steps' [attributes](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/command-step#command-step-attributes) for a similar [approach](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/command-step#fast-fail-running-jobs). |
