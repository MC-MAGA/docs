# Bitbucket Pipelines

With the help of the [Buildkite migration tool](/docs/pipelines/migration/tool), you can start converting your Bitbucket pipelines into Buildkite pipelines. This page lists the Buildkite migration tool's currently supported, partially supported, and unsupported attributes for translating from Bitbucket pipelines to Buildkite pipelines.

> ðŸ“˜
> The Bitbucket Pipeline configuration that is referred to in various sections below is specified in the central `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` within a specific Bitbucket workspace [repository](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/what-is-a-workspace/). In Buildkite, the pipeline configuration can be set in a singular `pipeline.yml` within a repository or it can also be set and uploaded dynamically through the use of [Dynamic Pipelines](/docs/pipelines/configure/dynamic-pipelines). Additionally, control and governance of Buildkite pipelines can be achieved through the use of [Pipeline Templates](/docs/pipelines/templates) to set shared pipeline configuration within a Buildkite organization.

## Using the Buildkite migration tool with Bitbucket

To start converting your Bitbucket pipelines to the Buildkite format:

1. Go to the [interactive web tool](https://buildkite.com/resources/migrate/) page.
1. Select **Bitbucket** in the UI.
1. Paste your Bitbucket pipeline configuration.
1. Click **Convert**.
1. See the converted pipeline configuration on the **Buildkite Pipeline** side of the tool.

For example, you would like to convert the following Bitbucket pipeline configuration:

```yml
image: node:18

pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        name: Build
        script:
          - npm install
```

This is the output that the Buildkite migration tool is going to provide:

```yml
---
steps:
- commands:
  - npm install
  plugins:
  - docker#v5.10.0:
      image: node:18
  label: Build
```

You will see the following in the Buildkite migration tool UI during the conversion of the example configuration:

<%= image "migration-tool-bitbucket.png", alt: "Converting a Bitbucket pipeline in Buildkite migration tool's web UI" %>

> ðŸ“˜ Local API use
> While the web-based migration tool provides a convenient interface for converting your existing pipelines, you can also run the Buildkite migration tool [locally via its HTTP API](/docs/pipelines/migration/tool#local-API-based-version). The local version offers the same conversion capabilities as the web interface.

You might need to adjust the syntax of the resulting converted output to make it is consistent with the [step configuration conventions](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types) syntax used in Buildkite Pipelines.

> ðŸ“˜
> Remember that not all the features of Bitbucket can be fully converted to the Buildkite Pipelines format. See the following sections to learn more about the compatibility, workarounds, and limitation of converting Bitbucket pipelines to Buildkite Pipelines.

## Clone

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clone` | Partially | Clone options for all steps of a Bitbucket pipeline. The majority of these options need to be set on a Buildkite agent itself via [configuration](/docs/agent/v3/configuration) of properties such as the clone flags (`git-clone-flags` or `git-clone-mirror-flags` if utilizing a Git mirror), fetch flags (`git-fetch-flags`) - or changing the entire checkout process in a customized [plugin](/docs/plugins/writing) overriding the default agent `checkout` hook. <br/><br/> Sparse-checkout properties of `code-mode`, `enabled`, and `patterns` will be translated to the respective properties within the [sparse-checkout-buildkite-plugin](https://buildkite.com/resources/plugins/buildkite-plugins/sparse-checkout-buildkite-plugin/). <br/><br/> `clone` properties in a Bitbucket pipeline have higher precedence over these global properties. |

## Definitions

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `definitions` | Partially | Customized definitions utilized in a Bitbucket pipeline. `caches` and `services` are supported for translation within Buildkite Migration tool. |
| `definitions.caches` | Partially | Customized cache definitions that can be applied to specific Bitbucket pipeline steps - inclusive of folders, single file-cache, or multi-file cache. Targeted into specific steps with the `pipelines.default.step.caches.<name>` property, where the translation will utilize the [cache-buildkite-plugin](https://buildkite.com/resources/plugins/buildkite-plugins/cache-buildkite-plugin/) that may require further setup and configuring around specific caching strategies. |
| `definitions.caches.<name>` | Yes | A customized cache name applicable to one or more steps within a Bitbucket pipeline. |
| `definitions.caches.<name>.path` | Yes | The directory path that is desired to be cached. |
| `definitions.caches.<name>.key.files` | Partially | The list (one or more) files that are monitored for changes - and stored once the hash changes between file versions change. If multiple files are specified, then multiple cache-plugin definitions are set on the resulting Buildkite command step (so the `manifest` properties between each will be different). <br/><br/> Note this may cause issues if the same folder is being maintained by each cache definition! |
| `definitions.pipeline` | Partially | Pipelines that are exported for re-use within repositories of the same workspace. A similar functionality exists within Buildkite and is called [Pipeline Templates](/docs/pipelines/templates). |
| `definitions.services` | Partially | Defined Docker services that are applied within a Bitbucket pipeline. Services defined in a corresponding Bitbucket pipeline step using the `pipelines.default.step.services` property will have its configuration applied with the use of the [docker-compose-buildkite-plugin](https://buildkite.com/resources/plugins/buildkite-plugins/docker-compose-buildkite-plugin/). <br/><br/> Generated configuration will need to be saved to a `compose.yaml` file within the repository, and the image utilized with the Buildkite command step as `app`. <br/><br/> Refer to the Bitbucket pipelines [documentation](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/databases-and-service-containers/) for more details on service containers and configuration references. <br/><br/> Authentication-based parameters will not be translated to the corresponding Buildkite pipeline if defined. |

## Export

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `export` | No | Bitbucket Premium option for sharing pipeline configurations between workspaces. Not applicable within Buildkite as an attribute, however, similar functionality exists in Buildkite Pipelines within [Pipeline Templates](/docs/pipelines/templates). |

## Image

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `image` | Yes | The container image that is to be applied to each step within a Bitbucket pipeline, utilizing the specified image within the [docker-buildkite-plugin](https://buildkite.com/resources/plugins/buildkite-plugins/docker-buildkite-plugin/). This has lower precedence over per-step `image` configuration (see `pipelines.default.step.image`). |
| `aws`, `aws.oidc`, `name`, `username`, `password` | Partially | Supported through the use of the corresponding plugin ([Docker Login](https://buildkite.com/resources/plugins/buildkite-plugins/docker-login-buildkite-plugin) or [ECR](https://buildkite.com/resources/plugins/buildkite-plugins/ecr-buildkite-plugin/)). |

## Options

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `options` | Partially | Customized options utilized throughout a Bitbucket pipeline. |
| `max-time`, `size`| Partially | These sub-properties are supported for translation within the Buildkite migration tool into the generated Buildkite command step's `timeout_in_minutes` and agent tag respectively. |
| `docker` | No| This sub-property is not supported and will depend on the agent configuration that the corresponding Buildkite command step is being targeted to run said job has available. |

Note that both supported properties in the Bitbucket pipeline step-level definition will have higher precedences than the two values set at `options` level. |

## Pipeline starting conditions

> ðŸ“˜
> Bitbucket Pipelines allows the configuration of various pipeline start conditions, with each condition supporting different configuration and permissible properties like `branches`, `custom`, `default`, `pull_request`, `tags`, and more.

## Pipeline properties

> ðŸ“˜
> Each [starting pipeline condition](#pipeline-starting-conditions) in Bitbucket can support various pipeline properties like `parallel`, `step`, `stage`, `variables` and so on.
> For information on each of these individual properties, refer to the reference within the Bitbucket Pipelines documentation for [parallel](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/parallel-step-options/#Parallel), [step](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/step-options/#The-Step-property), [stage](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/stage-options/#Stage) and [variable](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/pipeline-start-conditions/#Custom--manual--pipeline-variables) properties.
>
> Additionally, implementation of these pipeline properties can be enhanced with best practices by using [Dynamic Pipelines](/docs/pipelines/configure/dynamic-pipelines) to generate and upload pipeline configuration dynamically and using [conditionals](/docs/pipelines/configure/conditionals#conditionals-in-pipelines) at both pipeline level and step level to apply jobs only when certain conditions are met, and setting [trigger steps](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/trigger-step) with required attributes and environment variable configurations passed through to the triggered builds.

### Parallel

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.parallel` | Yes | The grouping of multiple steps within a Bitbucket pipeline to be run concurrently. By default, Buildkite executes steps in parallel, unless [implicit or explicit dependencies](/docs/pipelines/dependencies) are set. Parallel Bitbucket pipeline steps are transitioned into a [group step](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/group-step) within the generated Buildkite pipeline without explicit dependencies. |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.parallel.fail-fast` | No | Whether a Bitbucket pipeline allows this parallel step to fail entirely if it fails (set as `true`), or allows failures (set as `false`). Consider using a combination of `soft_fail` and/or `cancel_on_build_failing` in the corresponding Buildkite command steps' [attributes](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/command-step#command-step-attributes) for a similar [approach](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/command-step#fast-fail-running-jobs). |

### Variables

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.variables` | Partially | Custom variables that are passed to Bitbucket pipeline steps. Each variable defined in a Bitbucket pipeline step is translated to a Buildkite [input step](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/input-step) with/without defaults and allowed values specified below. <br/><br/> Variables that are translated into the corresponding [input step](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/input-step) within the generated Buildkite pipeline will require to be fetched in subsequent steps through a `buildkite-agent meta-data get` [command](/docs/agent/v3/cli-meta-data#getting-data). |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.variables.name` | Yes | The variables' name: translated to the `key` attribute of a specific `field` of an [input step](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/input-step) (text entry).|
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.variables.default` | Yes | The default variable value if no value is set. Set as the `default` attribute within the `field` of an [input step](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/input-step). |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.variables.description` | Yes | The description of the variable. Translated to the `text` attribute of a specific `field` within the generated  [input step](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/input-step). |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.variables.allowed-values` | Yes | The variable's allowed values: each option is translated to a singular `options` object with given value of a specific `field` of an [input step](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/input-step). |
