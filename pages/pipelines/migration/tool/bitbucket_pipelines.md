# Bitbucket Pipelines

This page list the Buildkite Migration tool's currently supported, partially supported and unsupported properties in translation of Bitbucket pipelines to Buildkite pipelines.

> ðŸ“˜
> The Bitbucket Pipeline configuration that is described in the various sections below is specified in the central `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` within a specific Bitbucket workspace [repository](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/what-is-a-workspace/). In Buildkite - pipeline configuration can be set in a singular `pipeline.yml` within a repository - but can also be set and uploaded dynamically through the use of [Dynamic Pipelines](/docs/pipelines/dynamic-pipelines). Additionally, control and governance of Buildkite pipelines can be achieved by the use of [Pipeline Templates](/docs/pipelines/templates) to set shared pipeline configuration within a Buildkite organization.

## Clone

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clone` | Partially | Clone options for all steps of a Bitbucket pipeline. The majority of these options should be set on a Buildkite agent itself via [configuration](/docs/agent/v3/configuration) of properties such as the clone flags (`git-clone-flags`, `git-clone-mirror-flags` if utilising a Git mirror), fetch flags (`git-fetch-flags`) - or changing the entire checkout process in a customised [plugin](/docs/plugins/writing) overriding the default agent `checkout` hook. <br/><br/> Sparse-checkout properties of `code-mode`, `enabled` and `patterns` will be translated to the respective properties within the [sparse-checkout-buildkite-plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/sparse-checkout-buildkite-plugin). <br/><br/> `clone` properties at the Bitbucket pipeline, if set, have higher precedence over these global properties. |

## Definitions

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `definitions` | Partially | Customised definitions utilised throughout a Bitbucket pipeline. `caches` and `services` are supported for translation within Buildkite Migration tool. |
| `definitions.caches` | Partially | Customised cache definitions that can be applied to specific Bitbucket pipeline steps - inclusive of folders, single file - or multi-file cache. Targeted into specific steps with the `pipelines.default.step.caches.<name>` property, and in which the translation will utilise the [cache-buildkite-plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/cache-buildkite-plugin) that may require further setup/tweaking around specific caching strategies. |
| `definitions.caches.<name>` | Yes | A customised cache name applicable for one or more steps within a Bitbucket pipeline. |
| `definitions.caches.<name>.path` | Yes | The directory path that is desired to be cached. |
| `definitions.caches.<name>.key.files` | Partially | The list (one or more) files that are monitored for changes - and stored once its hash changes between file versions change. If multiple files are specified - multiple cache-plugin definitions are set on the resultant Buildkite command step (differing `manifest` properties between each). <br/><br/> Note this may cause issues if the same folder is being maintained by each cache definition! |
| `definitions.pipeline` | Partially | Pipelines that are exported for re-use within repositories of the same workspace. Like functionality exists within Buildkite as [Pipeline Templates](/docs/pipelines/templates). |
| `definitions.services` | Partially | Defined Docker services that are applied within a Bitbucket pipeline. Services defined in a corresponding Bitbucket pipeline step using the `pipelines.default.step.services` property will have its configuration applied with the use of the [docker-compose-buildkite-plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/docker-compose-buildkite-plugin). <br/><br/> Generated configuration will need to be saved to a `compose.yaml` file within the repository, and the image utilised with the Buildkite command step as `app`. <br/><br/> Refer to the Bitbucket pipelines [documentation](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/databases-and-service-containers/) for more details on service containers and configuration references. <br/><br/> Authentication based parameters will not be translated to the corresponding Buildkite pipeline if defined. |

## Export

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `export` | No | Bitbucket Premium option of sharing pipeline configuration between workspaces. Not applicable within Buildkite as an attribute - like functionality exists within [Pipeline Templates](/docs/pipelines/templates). |

## Image

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `image` | Yes | The container image that is to be applied for each step within a Bitbucket pipeline, utilising the specified image within the [docker-buildkite-plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/docker-buildkite-plugin). This has lower precedence over per-step `image` configuration (see `pipelines.default.step.image`). <br/><br/> The `aws`, `aws.oidc`, `name`, `username` and `password` sub-properties are supported through the use of the corresponding plugin ([Docker Login](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/docker-login-buildkite-plugin/) or [ECR](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/ecr-buildkite-plugin/)). |

## Options

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `options` | Partially | Customised options utilised throughout a Bitbucket pipeline. The `max-time` and `size` sub-properties are supported for translation within Buildkite Migration tool through to the generated Buildkite command step's `timeout_in_minutes` and agent tag respectfully. <br/></br> The `docker` sub-property is not supported: and will depend on the agent configuration that the corresponding Buildkite command step is being targeted to run said job has available. <br/><br/> Both supported properties at Bitbucket pipeline step-level definition will have higher precedences than the two values set at `options` level. |

## Pipeline starting conditions

> ðŸ“˜
> Bitbucket Pipelines allows the configuration of various pipeline start conditions: each supporting different configuration and permissible properties:
> - `branches`: Defines the branch-specific configuration of a Bitbucket pipeline.
> - `custom`: A customised starting condition whereby only manual triggering is allowed.
> - `default`: The default starting configuration of a Bitbucket pipeline if it does not fall into one of the other conditions.
> - `pull_request`: Defines the pull-request specific configuration of a Bitbucket pipeline.
> - `tags`: Defines the tag specific configuration of a Bitbucket pipeline.
>
> For information on each of these individual starting conditions, refer to the reference within the Bitbucket Pipelines [documentation](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/pipeline-start-conditions/#Custom--manual--pipeline-variables).

## Pipeline properties

> ðŸ“˜
> Each starting pipeline condition listed [above](#pipeline-starting-conditions) can support various pipeline properties:
> - `parallel`: The grouping of multiple steps within a Bitbucket pipeline to run concurrently.
> - `step`: A logical execution unit that makes up a specific workflow within a Bitbucket pipeline.
> - `stage`: The grouping of multiple Bitbucket pipeline steps with shared properties.
> - `variables`: Customized variable definition to utilise within a custom Bitbucket pipeline starting condition.
>
> For information on each of these individual properties, refer to the reference within the Bitbucket Pipelines documentation for [parallel](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/parallel-step-options/#Parallel), [step](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/step-options/#The-Step-property), [stage](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/stage-options/#Stage) and [variable](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/pipeline-start-conditions/#Custom--manual--pipeline-variables) properties.
>
> Additionally, implementation of these pipeline properties can be enhanced with best practices through the use of [Dynamic Pipelines](/docs/pipelines/dynamic-pipelines) to generate and upload pipeline configuration dynamically, using [conditionals](/docs/pipelines/conditionals#conditionals-in-pipelines) at both pipelines/step level to apply jobs only on certain conditions and setting [trigger steps](/docs/pipelines/trigger-step) with required attributes/environment variable configuration passed through to triggered builds.

### Parallel

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.parallel` | Yes | The grouping of multiple steps within a Bitbucket pipeline that are to be run concurrently. By default, Buildkite executes steps in parallel unless [implicit or explicit dependencies](/docs/pipelines/dependencies) are set. Parallel Bitbucket pipeline steps are transitioned into a [group step](/docs/pipelines/group-step) within the generated Buildkite pipeline without explicit dependencies. |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.parallel.fail-fast` | No | Whether a Bitbucket pipeline allows this parallel step to fail entirely if it fails (set as `true`), or allows failures (set as `false`). Consider using a combination of `soft_fail` and/or `cancel_on_build_failing` in the corresponding Buildkite command steps' [attributes](/docs/pipelines/command-step#command-step-attributes) for a similar [approach](/docs/pipelines/command-step#fail-fast). |

### Step

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.step.after-script` | No | The actions that a Bitbucket pipeline will undertake after the commands in the `script` key are run. For similar behaviour, a [repository-level](/docs/agent/v3/hooks#hook-locations-repository-hooks) `pre-exit` hook approach will yield similar behaviour - running at the latter end of the [job lifecycle](/docs/agent/v3/hooks#job-lifecycle-hooks). |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.step.artifacts` | Partially | Build artifacts that will be required for steps later in the Bitbucket pipeline (by default, not obtained unless an explicit `buildkite-agent artifact download` [command](/docs/agent/v3/cli-artifact#downloading-artifacts) is run beforehand within the generated Buildkite command step). Artifacts that are specified (whether one specific file, or multiple) will be set within the generated command step within the `artifact_paths` [key](/docs/pipelines/command-step). Each file found matching (or via glob syntax) will be uploaded to Buildkite's [Artifact storage](/docs/agent/v3/cli-artifact) that can be obtained in later steps. |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.step.caches` | Yes | Step-level dependencies downloaded from external sources (Docker, Maven, PyPi for example) which will be able to be re-used in later Bitbucket pipeline steps. Caches that are set at step level (or through the top-level `definition.cache.<name>` property) are translated in the corresponding Buildkite pipeline utilising the [cache-buildkite-plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/cache-buildkite-plugin) to store the downloaded dependencies for re-use between Buildkite builds. |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.step.condition` | Partially | The configuration to prevent a Bitbucket pipeline step from running unless the specific conditional is met. Translated to an inline conditional (`if`) within the corresponding Buildkite pipelines' command step's `commands` - based on a `git diff` of the base branch. |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.step.condition.changeset.includePaths` | Partially | The specific file (or files) that need to be detected as changed for the `condition` to apply based. This can be set as specific files - or wildcards that match multiple files in a specific directory/directories. <br/><br/> Translated to a script that will review the changed files through git. This means that the step itself will actually run and just be marked as passed, which may not be what you want or need. <br/><br/> You may want to consider utilising the [monorepo-diff-buildkite-plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/monorepo-diff-buildkite-plugin); watching for specific folders/files and uploading resultant [Dynamic pipelines](/docs/pipelines/configure/dynamic-pipelines) upon diff detection. |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.step.clone` | Partially | Clone options for a specific step of a Bitbucket pipeline. The majority of these options should be set on a Buildkite agent itself via [configuration](/docs/agent/v3/configuration) of properties such as the clone flags (`git-clone-flags`, `git-clone-mirror-flags` if utilising a Git mirror), fetch flags (`git-fetch-flags`) - or changing the entire checkout process in a customised [plugin](/docs/plugins/writing) overriding the default agent `checkout` hook. Sparse checkout options are supported (with the `sparse-checkout` sub-property) |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.step.deployment` | No | The environment set for the Bitbucket Deployments dashboard. This has no translatable equivalent within Buildkite. |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.step.docker` | No | The availability of docker in a specific Bitbucket pipeline step. This will depend on the agent configuration that the corresponding Buildkite command step is being targeted to run said job has available. Consider [tagging](/docs/agent/v3/cli-start#tags) agents with `docker=true` to ensure Buildkite command steps requiring hosts with Docker installed and configured to accept/run specific jobs. |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.step.fail-fast` | No | Whether a specific step of a Bitbucket pipeline allows a parallel step to fail entirely if it fails (set as `true`), or allows failures (set as `false`). Consider using a combination of `soft_fail` and/or `cancel_on_build_failing` in the corresponding Buildkite command steps' [attributes](/docs/pipelines/command-step#command-step-attributes) for a similar [approach](/docs/pipelines/command-step#fail-fast). |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.step.image` | Yes | The container image that is to be applied for a specific step within a Bitbucket pipeline. Images set at this level will be applied irrespective of the pipeline-level `image` key that is set, and will be applied in the corresponding Buildkite pipeline using the [docker-buildkite-plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/docker-buildkite-plugin). <br/><br/> The `aws`, `aws.oidc`, `name`, `username` and `password` sub-properties are supported through the use of the corresponding plugin ([Docker Login](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/docker-login-buildkite-plugin/) or [ECR](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/ecr-buildkite-plugin/)). |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.step.max-time` | Yes | The maximum allowable time that a step within a Bitbucket pipeline is able to run for. Translates to the corresponding Buildkite pipelines' command step `timeout_in_minutes` attribute. |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.step.name` | Yes | The name of a specific step within a Bitbucket pipeline. Translates to a Buildkite command step's `label`. |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.step.oidc` | Yes | Open ID Connect configuration that will be applied for this Bitbucket pipeline step. The generated command step in the corresponding Buildkite pipeline will [request](/docs/agent/v3/cli-oidc#request-oidc-token) an OIDC token and export it into the job environment as `BITBUCKET_STEP_OIDC_TOKEN` (to be passed to `sts` to assume an AWS role for example) |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.step.runs-on` | Yes | Allocating the Bitbucket pipeline to run on a self-hosted runner with the specific label. All `runs-on` values will be set as agent [tags](/docs/pipelines/defining-steps#targeting-specific-agents) in the Buildkite command step for targeting on specific Buildkite agents within an organization. |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.step.services` | Partially | The name of one or more services defined at `definitions.services.<name>` that will be applied for this step. Translated to utilise the service configuration with the [docker-compose-buildkite-plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/docker-compose-buildkite-plugin). <br/><br/> Generated configuration will need to be saved to a `compose.yaml` file within the repository, and the image utilised with the Buildkite command step as `app`. <br/><br/> Refer to the Bitbucket pipelines [documentation](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/databases-and-service-containers/) for more details on service containers and configuration references. <br/><br/> Authentication based parameters will not be translated to the corresponding Buildkite pipeline if defined. |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.step.script` | Yes | The individual commands that make up a specific step. Each is translated into a singular command within the `commands` key of a Buildkite command step. |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.step.script.pipe` | No | Re-usable modules to make configuration in Bitbucket pipelines easier and modular. Consider exploring the suite of available [Buildkite Plugins](/docs/pipelines/integrations/plugins) for corresponding functionality that is required. |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.step.size` | Yes | Allocation of sizing options for the given memory for a specific step within a Bitbucket pipeline. The `size` value will be set as an agent [tag](/docs/pipelines/defining-steps#targeting-specific-agents) in the Buildkite command step for targeting on specific Buildkite agents within an organization. |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.step.trigger` | Yes | The configuration setting the running of a Bitbucket pipeline step manually or automatically (latter being defaulted). For `manual` triggers - an [input step](/docs/pipelines/input-step) is inserted into the generated Buildkite pipeline before the specified `script` within a further command step. Explicit dependencies with `depends_on` are set between the two steps; requiring manual processing. |

### Stage

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.stage` | Yes | The logical grouping of one or more Bitbucket pipeline steps. Bitbucket pipeline stages are translated into the corresponding Buildkite pipeline as a [group step](/docs/pipelines/group-step). |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.stage.condition.changeset.includePaths` | Partially | The specific file (or files) that need to be detected as changed for the `condition` to apply based. This can be set as specific files - or wildcards that match multiple files in a specific directory/directories. <br/><br/> Translated to a script that will review the changed files through git. This means that the step itself will actually run and just be marked as passed, which may not be what you want or need. <br/><br/> You may want to consider utilising the [monorepo-diff-buildkite-plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/monorepo-diff-buildkite-plugin); watching for specific folders/files and uploading resultant [Dynamic pipelines](/docs/pipelines/configure/dynamic-pipelines) upon diff detection. |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.stage.name` | Yes | The name of the Bitbucket pipeline stage. Transitioned to the `group` label of the corresponding Buildkite [group step](/docs/pipelines/group-step). |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.stage.steps` | Yes | Individual step configuration for a Bitbucket pipeline stage. See configuration options in this section (`pipelines.default.step.<property>`) for supported/unsupported properties. |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.stage.trigger` | Yes | The configuration setting the running of a Bitbucket pipeline stage manually or automatically (latter being defaulted). For `manual` triggers - an [input step](/docs/pipelines/input-step) is inserted into the generated Buildkite pipeline's group step before the specified `steps` of this stage. An explicit dependencies with `depends_on` are set between the input step and the following steps to ensure manual processing is required for these to run. |

### Variables

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.variables` | Partially | Custom variables that are passed to Bitbucket pipeline steps. Each variable defined in a Bitbucket pipeline step is translated to a Buildkite [input step](/docs/pipelines/input-step) with/without defaults and allowed values specified below. <br/><br/> Variables that are translated into the corresponding [input step](/docs/pipelines/input-step) within the generated Buildkite pipeline will require to be fetched in subsequent steps through a `buildkite-agent meta-data get` [command](/docs/agent/v3/cli-meta-data#getting-data). |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.variables.name` | Yes | The variables' name: translated to the `key` attribute of a specific `field` of an [input step](/docs/pipelines/input-step) (text entry).|
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.variables.default` | Yes | The default variable value if no value is set. Set as the `default` attribute within the `field` of an [input step](/docs/pipelines/input-step). |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.variables.description` | Yes | The description of the variable. Translated to the `text` attribute of a specific `field` within the generated  [input step](/docs/pipelines/input-step). |
| `pipelines.<start-condition>.variables.allowed-values` | Yes | The variable's allowed values: each option is translated to a singular `options` object with given value of a specific `field` of an [input step](/docs/pipelines/input-step). |
