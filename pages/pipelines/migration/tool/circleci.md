# CircleCI

The [Buildkite migration tool](/docs/pipelines/migration/tool) helps you convert your CircleCI pipelines into Buildkite pipelines. This page lists the Buildkite migration tool's currently supported, partially supported, and unsupported keys for translating from CircleCI pipeline configurations to Buildkite pipelines.

## Using the Buildkite migration tool with CircleCI

To start converting your CircleCI pipeline configurations into Buildkite Pipelines format:

1. Open the [Buildkite migration interactive web tool](https://buildkite.com/resources/migrate/) in a new browser tab.
1. Select **CircleCI** at the top of the left panel.
1. Copy your CircleCI pipeline configuration and paste it into the left panel.
1. Select **Convert** to reveal the translated pipeline configuration in the **Buildkite Pipeline** panel.

For example, when converting the following example CircleCI pipeline configuration:

```yml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:18.20

    steps:
      - checkout

      - run:
          name: Install dependencies
          command: npm install

workflows:
  build-workflow:
    jobs:
      - build
```

The Buildkite migration tool should translate this to the following output:

```yml
---
steps:
- commands:
  - "# No need for checkout, the agent takes care of that"
  - echo '~~~ Install dependencies'
  - npm install
  plugins:
  - docker#v5.10.0:
      image: cimg/node:18.20
  agents:
    executor_type: docker
  key: build
```

The Buildkite migration tool interface should look similar to this:

<%= image "migration-tool-circleci.png", alt: "Converting a CircleCI pipeline in Buildkite migration tool's web UI" %>

You might need to adjust the converted Buildkite pipeline output to ensure it is consistent with the [step configuration conventions](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types) used in Buildkite Pipelines.

The Buildkite migration tool supports the use of [YAML aliases in CircleCI pipeline configurations](https://circleci.com/docs/guides/getting-started/introduction-to-yaml-configurations/#anchors-and-aliases), which are reusable configuration snippets that can applied to specific points in a pipeline configuration. A YAML alias is defined by an `&` (anchor, for example, `&tests`) within the top-level `aliases` key and substituted into a CircleCI pipeline configuration with an `*` (for example, `*tests`). A configuration defined by an alias is respected and parsed at its specified section in the pipeline configuration. Also note that more complex (for example, multi-line) anchors defined as a YAML alias in a CircleCI pipeline configuration are expanded upon their translation into Buildkite pipeline format.

> Remember that not all the features of CircleCI can be fully converted to the Buildkite Pipelines format. See the following sections to learn more about the compatibility, workarounds, and limitation of converting CircleCI pipelines to Buildkite Pipelines.

## Logical operators (helpers)

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `and` | Partially | Logical operator for denoting that all inputs required to be true. Supported alongside the `when` key within setting up conditional `workflow` runs. |
| `or` | Partially | Logical operator for describing whether any of the inputs are true. Supported alongside the `when` key within setting up conditional `workflow` runs. |
| `not` | Partially | Logical operator for negating input. Supported alongside the `when` key within setting up conditional `workflow` runs. |

## Commands

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `commands` | Yes | A `command` defined in a CircleCI pipeline is a reusable set of instructions with parameters that can be inserted into required `job` executions. Commands can have their own lists of `steps` that are translated through to the generated [command step](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/command-step)'s `commands`. If a `command` contains a `parameters` key, these parameters are respected when used in jobs and workflows. When not specified, the parameters' default values are used. |
{: class="responsive-table"}

## Executors

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `executors` | Yes | The `executor` key defined at the top level in a CircleCI workflow is mapped to the use of the `executor` key specified within a specific `job`. Supported execution environments include `machine`, `docker`, `macos`, and `windows`. Further information can be found in the [Jobs > Executors](/docs/pipelines/migration/tool/circleci#jobs-executors) table below. The execution environment in Buildkite Pipelines is specified with each environment's applied [tags](/docs/agent/v3/cli-start#setting-tags) in their generated [command step](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/command-step), which can be [targeted](/docs/pipelines/configure/defining-steps#targeting-specific-agents) when creating builds. |

### Executors

While the Buildkite migration tool will translate the following listed executor types, the prerequisite for using the generated steps in your translated Buildkite pipeline, requires that the targeted agents have the relevant operating system (OS), dependencies, and tooling (for example, Docker or XCode) available. Buildkite offers the [Elastic CI Stack for AWS](/docs/agent/v3/aws/elastic-ci-stack) as a fully scalable Buildkite Agent fleet on AWS with a suite of tooling installed by default. Additionally, customized agents can be [set up](/docs/agent/v3/configuration) to target builds that requires a specific OS, tooling, or both. Or you can use [Buildkite hosted agents](/docs/pipelines/hosted-agents)â€”a fully managed solution offered by Buildkite.

## Orbs

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `orbs` | No | Orbs are currently not supported by the Buildkite migration tool and should be translated by hand if their equivalent functionality is required within a Buildkite pipeline. In Buildkite Pipelines, reusable [plugins](/docs/plugins/directory) can provide a similar functionality for integrating various common (and third-party integration-related) tasks throughout a Buildkite pipeline, such as [logging into ECR](https://buildkite.com/resources/plugins/buildkite-plugins/ecr-buildkite-plugin/), running a step within a [Docker container](https://buildkite.com/resources/plugins/buildkite-plugins/docker-buildkite-plugin/), running multiple Docker images through a [compose file](https://buildkite.com/resources/plugins/buildkite-plugins/docker-compose-buildkite-plugin/), triggering builds in a [monorepo setup](https://buildkite.com/resources/plugins/buildkite-plugins/monorepo-diff-buildkite-plugin/), to list a small number of these plugins. |
| `Docker orbs` | Partially | Docker orbs are converted but their translation is only an approximation. It is recommended that any orb-related logic is rebuilt in a Buildkite pipeline instead based on the recommendations outlined in `orbs`. |
{: class="responsive-table"}

## Parameters

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `parameters` | No | Pipeline-level parameters that can be used in the pipeline-level configuration. Pipeline-level [environment variables](/docs/pipelines/environment-variables#defining-your-own) allow for utilizing variables in a Buildkite pipeline configuration with [conditionals](/docs/pipelines/configure/conditionals). |
{: class="responsive-table"}

## Setup

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `setup` | No | Allows for the conditional configuration trigger from outside the `.circleci` directory. While this is not directly compatible with Buildkite Pipelines, Buildkite Pipelines offers [trigger steps](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/trigger-step), which allow for triggering builds from another pipeline. |
{: class="responsive-table"}

## Version

| Key | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | No | The version of the CircleCI pipeline configuration applied to this pipeline. No equivalent mapping exists in Buildkite Pipelines. Attributes for required and optional attributes in the various step types that are supported in Buildkite Pipelines are listed in the [Step type overview documentation](/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types) for each of the possible step types. |
