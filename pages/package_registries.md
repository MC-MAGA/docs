# Buildkite Package Registries

Scale out asset management for faster builds and deployments across any ecosystem with _Buildkite Package Registries_. Secure your supply chain and avoid the bottlenecks of poorly managed and insecure dependencies.

Package Registries allows you to:

- Manage artifacts and packages from [Buildkite Pipelines](/docs/pipelines), as well as other CI/CD applications that require artifact management.

- Provide registries to store your [packages and other package-like file formats](/docs/package-registries/background) such as container images and Terraform modules.

As well as storing a collection of packages, a registry also surfaces metadata or attributes associated with a package, such as the package's description, version, contents (files and directories), checksum details, distribution type, dependencies, and so on.

> Customers on legacy Buildkite plans can enable [Package Registries](https://buildkite.com/platform/package-registries) through the [**Organization Settings** page](/docs/package-registries/security/permissions#enabling-buildkite-packages).
