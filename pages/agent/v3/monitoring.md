# Monitoring and observing the Buildkite Agent

By default, the agent is only observable either through Buildkite or
through log output on the host:

- **Job logs:** Relate to the jobs the agent runs. These are uploaded to
  Buildkite and shown for each step in a build.
- **Agent logs:** Relate to how the agent itself is running. These are not
  uploaded or saved (except where the output from the agent is read or
  redirected by another process, such as [systemd] or [launchd]).

## Health checking and status page

The agent can optionally run an HTTP service that describes the agent's state.
The service is suitable for both automated health checks and human inspection.

You can enable the service with the `--health-check-addr` flag or
`$BUILDKITE_AGENT_HEALTH_CHECK_ADDR` environment variable. For example, to
enable the service listening on local port 3901, you can use:

```shell
buildkite-agent start --health-check-addr=:3901
```

The flag expects [a "host:port" address](https://pkg.go.dev/net#Dial).
Passing `:0` allows the agent to choose a port, which will be logged at startup.

For security reasons, we recommend that you do _not_ expose the service
directly to the internet. While there should be no ability to manipulate the
agent state using this service, it may expose information, or provide a vector
for a denial-of-service attack. We may also add new features to the service in
the future.

### Health checking service routes

The URL paths available from the health checking service are as follows:

- **`/`**: Returns HTTP status 200 with the text `OK: Buildkite agent is
  running`.
- **`/agent/(worker number)`**: Reports the time since the agent worker
  succeeded at sending a heartbeat. Workers are numbered starting from 1,
  and the number of workers is set with the `--spawn` flag. If the previous
  heartbeat for this worker failed, it returns HTTP status 500 and a description
  of the failure. Otherwise, it returns HTTP status 200.
- **`/status`**: A human-friendly page detailing various systems inside the
  agent. To aid debugging, this page does _not_ automatically refreshâ€”it shows
  the status of each internal component of the agent at a particular moment in
  time.

The following shows the `/status` page for an agent:

## Datadog metrics

The Buildkite Agent supports sending metrics to Datadog via DogStatsD for monitoring and observability.

To enable Datadog metrics, start the agent with the `--metrics-datadog` option or set `metrics-datadog=true` in the agent's configuration file.

```shell
buildkite-agent start --metrics-datadog
```

Additional configuration options:

Option                              | Description
----------------------------------- | -----------
`--metrics-datadog-host`           | The DogStatsD instance to send metrics to using UDP.<br>_Environment variable:_ `BUILDKITE_METRICS_DATADOG_HOST`<br>_Default:_ `127.0.0.1:8125`
`--metrics-datadog-distributions`  | Use [Datadog Distributions](https://docs.datadoghq.com/metrics/types/?tab=distribution#metric-types) for timing metrics. This is advisable when running multiple agents. Otherwise, metrics from multiple agents may be rolled up and appear to have the same value.<br>_Environment variable:_ `BUILDKITE_METRICS_DATADOG_DISTRIBUTIONS`<br>_Default:_ `false`
{: class="responsive-table"}

Once enabled, the agent will generate the following metrics (duration measured in milliseconds):

- `buildkite.jobs.success`
- `buildkite.jobs.duration.success.avg`
- `buildkite.jobs.duration.success.max`
- `buildkite.jobs.duration.success.count`
- `buildkite.jobs.duration.success.median`
- `buildkite.jobs.duration.success.95percentile`
