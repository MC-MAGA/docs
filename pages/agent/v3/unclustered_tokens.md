# Unclustered agent tokens

> ðŸš§ This page documents a deprecated Buildkite feature
> _It is not be possible to create and work with unclustered agents for any new Buildkite organizations created after the official release of clusters on February 26, 2024._ Therefore, unclustered agent tokens are not relevant to these organizations.
> Previously, agents only connected directly to Buildkite via a token which was created and managed by the processes described on this page. These tokens are now a deprecated feature of Buildkite, and are referred to as _unclustered agent tokens_. Unclustered agent tokens, however, are still available to customers who have not yet migrated their pipelines to a [cluster](/docs/pipelines/clusters).
> _Agent tokens_ are now associated with clusters, and connect to Buildkite through a specific cluster within an organization. Learn more about how to manage agent tokens for clusters in [Agent tokens](/docs/agent/v3/tokens) and how to [migrate your unclustered agents across to a cluster](/docs/pipelines/clusters/migrate-from-unclustered-to-clustered-agents).

Any Buildkite organization created before February 26, 2024 has an **Unclustered** area for managing _unclustered agents_, accessible through **Agents** (from the global navigation) > **Unclustered** of the Buildkite interface, where an _unclustered agent_ refers to any agent that is not associated with a cluster.

A Buildkite agent requires a token to connect to Buildkite and register for work. If you need to connect an _unclustered agent_ to Buildkite, then you need to create an _unclustered agent token_ to do so.

## The default token

<!-- Is this section still valid? Should this instead be called the 'initial unclustered agent token'? -->

Your Buildkite organization's unclustered agent tokens page, accessible through **Agents** (from the global navigation) > **Unclustered** > **Agent Tokens**, may have the **Default agent registration token**, which is the original default token when your organization was created. If you had previously saved this token's value in a safe place, this token can be used for testing and development. However, it's recommended that you [create new, specific tokens](#create-a-token) for each new environment.

## Using and storing tokens

An unclustered agent token is used by the Buildkite agent's [start](/docs/agent/v3/cli-start#starting-an-agent) command, and can be provided on the command line, set in the [configuration file](/docs/agent/v3/configuration), or provided using the [environment variable](/docs/pipelines/configure/environment-variables) `BUILDKITE_AGENT_TOKEN`.

It's recommended you use your platform's secret storage (such as the [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html)) to allow for easier rollover and management of your agent tokens.

## Create a token

New unclustered agent tokens can be created using the [GraphQL API](/docs/apis/graphql-api) with the `agentTokenCreate` mutation.

For example:

```graphql
mutation {
  agentTokenCreate(input: {
    organizationID: "organization-id",
    description: "A description"
  }) {
    tokenValue
    agentTokenEdge {
      node {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> ðŸ“˜ An unclustered agent token's value is only displayed once
> As soon as the unclustered agent token's value is displayed, copy its value and save it in a secure location.
> If you forget to do this, you'll need to create a new token to obtain its value.

You can find your `organization-id` in your Buildkite organization settings page, or by running the following GrapqQL query:

```graphql
query GetOrgID {
  organization(slug: "organization-slug") {
    id
  }
}
```

<!--alex ignore clearly-->

The token description should clearly identify the environment the token is intended to be used for (for example, `Read-only token for static site generator`), and is listed on the **Agent tokens** page of the **Agents** (from the global navigation) > **Unclustered** area.

It is possible to create multiple unclustered agent tokens using the GraphQL API.

## Revoke a token

Unclustered agent tokens can be revoked using the [GraphQL API](/docs/apis/graphql/cookbooks/agents#revoke-an-unclustered-agent-token) query with the `agentTokenRevoke ` mutation.

You need to pass your unclustered agent token as the ID in the mutation.

First, you can retrieve a list of agent token IDs using this query:

```graphql
query GetAgentTokenID {
  organization(slug: "organization-slug") {
    agentTokens(first:50) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          uuid
          description
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then, using the token ID, revoke the unclustered agent token:

```graphql
mutation {
  agentTokenRevoke(input: {
    id: "token-id",
    reason: "A reason"
  }) {
    agentToken {
      description
      revokedAt
      revokedReason
    }
  }
}
```

Once a token is revoked, no new agents will be able to start with that token. Revoking a token does not affect any connected agents.

## Scope of access

Unclustered agent tokens are specific to each Buildkite organization (created before February 26, 2024), and can be used to register an agent with any [unclustered queue](/docs/agent/v3/queues). Unclustered agent tokens can not be shared between organizations.

## Additional agent tokens

In addition to the initial unclustered agent token, the Buildkite Agent automatically generates and manages two internal types of tokens during its operation. These tokens are session tokens and job tokens.

### Session tokens

Session tokens are internal tokens that last for the lifetime of the agent connection. They are used by the agent to request and start new jobs, and remain valid until the agent disconnects from Buildkite.

### Job tokens

Job tokens are internal tokens that are generated for each individual job when it starts. They are exposed to the job as the [environment variable](/docs/pipelines/configure/environment-variables) `BUILDKITE_AGENT_ACCESS_TOKEN` and are used by the Buildkite agent's local Job API, which provides access to various CLI commands (including [annotate](/docs/agent/v3/cli-annotate), [artifact](/docs/agent/v3/cli-artifact), [meta-data](/docs/agent/v3/cli-meta-data), and [pipeline](/docs/agent/v3/cli-pipeline) commands). Job tokens are scoped to a single job for security, limiting both the duration and scope of access, and are valid until the job finishes.

To ensure job tokens have a limited lifetime, you can set a default or maximum [command timeout](/docs/pipelines/configure/build-timeouts#command-timeouts).

### Token exchange process

When an agent starts, it follows this token exchange process:

1. The agent connects to the Buildkite Agent API to register itself using its configured unclustered **agent token** (`BUILDKITE_AGENT_TOKEN`)
2. The Agent API generates and returns a **session token** to the agent
3. The agent uses this session token to poll for available jobs and manage its connection to Buildkite
4. When the agent accepts a job, Buildkite generates a **job token** specific to that job

    <td>Until the job finishes.</td>
  </tr>

> ðŸ“˜ Job tokens not supported in agents prior to v3.39.0
> Agents prior to v3.39.0 use the session token for the `BUILDKITE_AGENT_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable and the job APIs.
