# JavaScript

Buildkite Package Registries provides registry support for JavaScript-based (Node.js npm) packages.

Once your JavaScript source registry has been [created](/docs/package-registries/registries/manage#create-a-source-registry), you can publish/upload packages (generated from your application's build) to this registry by configuring your `~/.npmrc` and application's relevant `package.json` files with the command/code snippets presented on your JavaScript registry's details page.

To view and copy the required command/code snippet for your `~/.npmrc` and `package.json` configurations:

1. Select **Package Registries** in the global navigation to access the **Registries** page.
1. Select your JavaScript source registry on this page.
1. Select the **Publish Instructions** tab and on the resulting page, use the copy icon at the top-right of each respective code box to copy the its snippet and paste it into your command line tool or the appropriate file.

    These file configurations contain the following:
    * `~/.npmrc`: the URL for your specific JavaScript source registry in Buildkite and the API access token required to publish the package to this registry.
    * `package.json`: the URL for this source registry.

1. You can then run the `npm pack` and `npm publish` commands to publish the package to this source registry.

## Publish a package

The following steps describe the process above:

1. Copy the following `npm` command, paste it into your terminal, and modify as required before running to update your `~/.npmrc` file:

    ```bash
    npm set //packages.buildkite.com/{org.slug}/{registry.slug}/npm/:_authToken registry-write-token
    ```

    where:
    <%= render_markdown partial: 'package_registries/org_slug' %>
    <%= render_markdown partial: 'package_registries/javascript_registry_slug' %>
    <%= render_markdown partial: 'package_registries/javascript_registry_write_token' %>

    **Note:**
    * If your `.npmrc` file doesn't exist, this command automatically creates it for you.
    * This step only needs to be performed once for the life of your JavaScript source registry.

1. Copy the following JSON code snippet (or the line of code beginning `"publishConfig": ...`), paste it into your Node.js project's `package.json` file, and modify as required:

    ```json
    {
      ...,
      "publishConfig": {"registry": "https://packages.buildkite.com/{org.slug}/{registry.slug}/npm/"}
    }
    ```

    **Note:** Don't forget to add the separating comma between `"publishConfig": ...` and the previous field.

1. Build and publish your package:

    ```bash
    npm pack
    npm publish
    ```

## Access a package's details

A JavaScript package's details can be accessed from this registry through the **Releases** (tab) section of your JavaScript source registry page. To do this:

1. Select **Package Registries** in the global navigation to access the **Registries** page.
1. Select your JavaScript source registry on this page.
1. On your JavaScript source registry page, select the package to display its details page.

> ðŸ“˜
> If your JavaScript source registry is an upstream of a [composite registry](/docs/package-registries/registries/manage#composite-registries), you can also access a JavaScript package's details from this composite registry (listed on the **Registries** page) by selecting the relevant JavaScript composite registry > from the **Upstreams** tab, select the relevant JavaScript source registry, then its relevant package.

<%= render_markdown partial: 'package_registries/ecosystems/package_details_page_sections' %>

### Downloading a package

A JavaScript package can be downloaded from the package's details page. To do this:

1. [Access the package's details](#access-a-packages-details).
1. Select **Download**.

### Installing a package from a source registry

A JavaScript package can be installed using code snippet details provided on the package's details page. To do this:

1. [Access the package's details](#access-a-packages-details).
1. Ensure the **Installation** > **Instructions** section is displayed.
1. If your JavaScript source registry is _private_  (the default configuration for source registries) and you haven't already performed this `.npmrc` configuration step, copy the `npm set` command from the [**Registry Configuration**](#registry-configuration) section, paste it into your terminal, and modify as required before running to update your `~/.npmrc` file.
1. Copy the `npm install ...` command from the [**Package Installation**](#package-installation) section, paste it into your terminal, and modify as required before running it.

<h4 id="registry-configuration">Registry Configuration</h4>

If your JavaScript source registry is _private_, set its authentication details in the `.npmrc` file by running the `npm set` command:

```bash
npm set //packages.buildkite.com/{org.slug}/{registry.slug}/npm/:_authToken registry-read-token
```

where:

<%= render_markdown partial: 'package_registries/org_slug' %>

<%= render_markdown partial: 'package_registries/ecosystems/registry_slug' %>

- `registry-read-token` is your [API access token](https://buildkite.com/user/api-access-tokens) or [registry token](/docs/package-registries/registries/manage#configure-registry-tokens) used to download packages from your JavaScript source registry. Ensure this access token has the **Read Packages** REST API scope, which allows this token to download packages from any registry your user account has access to within your Buildkite organization.

> ðŸ“˜
> If your `.npmrc` file doesn't exist, this command automatically creates it for you.
> This step only needs to be performed once for the life of your JavaScript registry, and it is not required for public JavaScript registries.

<h4 id="package-installation">Package Installation</h4>

Install your JavaScript package by running the `npm install` command:

```bash
npm install nodejs-package-name@version.number \
  --registry https://packages.buildkite.com/{org.slug}/{registry.slug}/npm/
```

where:

- `nodejs-package-name` is the name of your Node.js package (that is, the `name` field value from its `package.json` file).

- `version.number` is the version of your Node.js package (that is, the `version` field value from its `package.json` file).

### Installing a package from a composite registry

If your JavaScript source registry is an upstream of a [composite registry](/docs/package-registries/registries/manage#composite-registries), you can install one of its packages using the code snippet details provided on the composite registry's **Setup & Usage** page. To do this:

1. Select **Package Registries** in the global navigation to access the **Registries** page.
1. Select your Python composite registry on this page.
1. Select the **Setup & Usage** tab to display the **Usage Instructions** page.
1. Configure the composite registry's URL in the `.npmrc` file. Learn more about this is [Composite registry configuration](#composite-registry-configuration), below.

<h4 id="composite-registry-configuration">Composite registry configuration</h4>

Open your `.npmrc` file and add the following lines to it:

```npmrc
# Set _authToken. `npm/` suffix must be omitted.
//packages.buildkite.com/{org.slug}/{registry.slug}/:_authToken=$TOKEN

# Set registry for all packages
registry=https://packages.buildkite.com/{org.slug}/{registry.slug}/npm/
```

where:

<%= render_markdown partial: 'package_registries/org_slug' %>

<%= render_markdown partial: 'package_registries/ecosystems/registry_slug' %>

- `registry-read-token` is your [API access token](https://buildkite.com/user/api-access-tokens) or [registry token](/docs/package-registries/registries/manage#configure-registry-tokens) used to download packages from your JavaScript composite registry. Ensure this access token has the **Read Packages** REST API scope, which allows this token to download packages from any registry your user account has access to within your Buildkite organization.

You can now install JavaScript packages from your composite registry using the abbreviated command `npm install package-name@version.number`.
