# Audit log

The **Audit Log** is an interactive track record of all organization activity. This feature is only available to Buildkite customers on the [Enterprise](https://buildkite.com/pricing) plan, and can be accessed by Buildkite organization administrators.

To access the **Audit Log** feature:

1. Select **Settings** in the global navigation to access the [**Organization Settings**](https://buildkite.com/organizations/~/settings) page.

1. Select **Audit** > **Audit Log** to access your organization's [**Audit Log**](https://buildkite.com/organizations/~/audit-log) page.

The Audit Log contains two tabs:

- **Events** - lists all the events that take place within your Buildkite organization. Learn more about which events are logged in [Logged events](#logged-events).

    <%= image "organization-activity.png", width: 1752/2, height: 1356/2, alt: "Organization activity in Audit Log" %>

- **Query & Export** - allows you to query and export your Buildkite organization's audit log using [GraphQL API](/docs/graphql-api).

    <%= image "query-and-export.png", width: 1752/2, height: 1250/2, alt: "Query and export of Audit Log" %>

The following GraphQL `Audit Event` types are available and you can find more details about them in the [GraphQL explorer](/docs/apis/graphql-api#getting-started).
