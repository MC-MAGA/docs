# Enforce two-factor authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication can be enforced for the whole organization to ensure that all users who access the organization have two-factor authentication enabled.

## Before enforcing two-factor authentication

Before you enforce two-factor authentication (2FA) for your organization, consider that users without 2FA enabled will immediately lose access to the organization and subsequent pipelines.

Users can set up 2FA by following the [2FA tutorial].

## Steps to enforce two-factor authentication

To enforce 2FA:

1. Ensure you are logged in as a [Buildkite organization administrator](/docs/platform/team-management/permissions#manage-teams-and-permissions-organization-level-permissions).
1. Access your Buildkite organization's **Settings** (in the global navigation) > [**Security** page](https://buildkite.com/organizations/~/security).
1. Select the **Enforce Two-factor authentication** checkbox.
1. Select **Update Access Control**.

## Programmatically enforcing two-factor authentication

Please review the GraphQL [cookbook] for instructions on how to enable
enforced 2FA via the GraphQL API.

## API access tokens

Enforcing 2FA does not invalidate existing [API access tokens][access-tokens]. Existing tokens will
continue to work, but users must enable 2FA before they can update existing tokens or create new ones.
