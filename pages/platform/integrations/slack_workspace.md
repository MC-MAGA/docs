# Slack Workspace

The Slack Workspace integration lets you receive notifications in your [Slack](https://slack.com/) workspace. This integration supports:

- [Pipelines build notifications](/docs/pipelines/integrations/notifications/slack-workspace)
- [Test Engine test notifications](/docs/test-engine/notifications/slack)

[Adding a **Slack Workspace** notification service](https://buildkite.com/organizations/-/services/slack_workspace/new) will authorize access for your entire Slack app for a given Slack workspace. You only need to set up this integration once per Slack workspace, after which, you can then configure notifications to be sent to any Slack channels or users.

> Setting up a Workspace requires Buildkite organization admin access.
