# Linear

The Linear integration lets you synchronize issues between [Linear](https://linear.app) and Buildkite Test Engine. This integration supports the creation of Linear issues based on [Test Engine workflows](/docs/test-engine/workflows/actions#creating-a-linear-issue).

> ðŸ“˜
> Setting up a Workspace requires Buildkite organization administrator permissions.

When adding a Linear integration through the [**Add Linear Notification** page](https://buildkite.com/organizations/-/services/linear/new), access for your entire Linear workspace will be authorized, along with all the teams contained within this workspace. You only need to set up this integration once per Linear workspace, after which, you can then configure action for any Linear team.
