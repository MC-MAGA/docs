# Saved views

**Saved Views** lets you create, name, and easily access custom test views within Test Engine. This is useful for teams who frequently search using the same set of tags or labels.

## Creating views

1. On the **Tests** page, select **Filter**, then select as many filter values as you would like.
1. Select **Display**, then select the columns you would like to appear in your view.
1. Select **Save** in the filter bar.
1. Give your view a name.
1. Select **Save view**.

Your new view will now appear in the sidebar under **Tests**, and will be visible to all users in the test suite.

<%= image "saved-views-test-index.png", width: 3144/2, height: 988/2, alt: "Screenshot of test index saved view" %>

## Deleting views

Saved views can be deleted from the test suite's settings:

1. Navigate to the test suite's **Settings** > **Saved Views**.
1. On the view to be deleted, select its **Delete** button.
