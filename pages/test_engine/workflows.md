# Workflows overview

A Workflow allows you to create custom mappings between _observations_ that Test Engine makes about your test suite, and the _actions_ that would like to take from them. This means that observations about the health and performance of your tests (for example: test is flaky) can generate automatic actions (for example: label the test as flaky, send a notification).

Workflows are composed of a single monitor, optional filters, and a number of different actions. The actionable insights generated by Workflows can be used to improve your test suite, for example by [reducing the number of flaky tests](/docs/test-engine/reduce-flaky-tests).

Configurable Workflows are available to customers on the [Pro and Enterprise plans](https://buildkite.com/pricing). Personal plan customers have one immutable workflow created for them, which uses the [passed on retry](/docs/test-engine/workflows/monitors#passed-on-retry) monitor to mark tests with the 'flaky' label, and will need to upgrade to modify or add workflows.
