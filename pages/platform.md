# The Buildkite Platform

The Buildkite Scale-Out Delivery Platform is an adaptable, composable, and scalable platform with everything platform teams need to build software delivery systems for their businessesâ€”and rapidly deliver value to users.

The Buildkite Platform documentation contains docs for _platform_-level features of Buildkite available across Buildkite [Pipelines](/docs/pipelines), [Test Engine](/docs/test-engine), and [Package Registries](/docs/package-registries). This area of the docs covers the following topics:

- [Team management](/docs/platform/team-management), with guidelines on how to manage your users and teams across the Buildkite platform for Pipelines, Test Engine, and Package Registries.

- [Audit log](/docs/platform/audit-log), which provides details on how to access this feature within Buildkite, and all the events that are logged by this feature.

- [Emojis](/docs/platform/emojis), which can be used in your pipelines, test suites, and platform, to help you distinguish them.

- [Buildkite CLI](/docs/platform/cli), which provides command line/terminal access to work with features across the Buildkite platform.

- [Single sign-on (SSO)](/docs/platform/sso), with guidelines on how to protect access to your Buildkite organization using a supported third-party SSO provider.

- [Security](/docs/platform/security/tokens), contains security-related topics which are relevant to the entire Buildkite platform.

- [Integrations](/docs/platform/integrations/slack-workspace), contains integrations with the Buildkite platform that function across multiple Buildkite products.
